Whether for business or pleasure, technology is built, utilized, and consumed to make an impact. As ubiquitous as technology is, I am left wondering why only a handful of girls are in most of my computer science classes. A recent Newsweek article,  "<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2015/02/06/what-silicon-valley-thinks-women-302821.html" target="_blank">What Silicon Valley Thinks of Women</a>", blames the underrepresentation of women in Silicon Valley on a sexist and cruel work environment. Painting Silicon Valley as backwards, using a misogynist scene from the 1950''s where females have very little chance of success, is not only exceptionally misinformed, it is downright dangerous. Women need computer skills in the 21st century. Companies need a diverse workforce to strengthen collaboration, problem solving, and innovation. The serious gender gap in technology poses an urgent problem: how do we inspire more women to pursue careers in Computer Science? I believe STEM exposure at all educational levels is key to raising the number of girls and women in Computer Science.<br><br><img alt="Image title" class="fr-fin fr-dib" src="http://i33.photobucket.com/albums/d80/dazedandconfused389/cs-women.jpg" width="641"><br>As a graduating senior (Spring 2015) in Computer Science at San Jose State University, I have an unquenchable passion for all things code. But unlike so many others in my major, I haven''t been coding my whole life. In fact, my journey in computer science started only three years ago, when all I knew of my direction was that I loved math. At the recommendation of the dean of engineering at my local community college, I enrolled in a beginning Java class and was hooked on programming ever since. In three short years, I devoured all the computer science I could; from my first "Hello World" script, to designing, building, and implementing professional dynamic web applications. So don''t ever think you can''t succeed in computer science if you don''t have any experience with it; as with anything, all you really need to learn programming is curiosity and passion. I''m grateful for finding guidance to a realm so spectacularly interwoven with brilliant threads of creativity and logic, spun to encapsulate and examine the limitless bounds of imagination. Based on my experience, I feel that not everybody receives an adequate introduction to coding. This is why I urge a call to action: exposure to STEM technology while practicing heuristic scientific thinking in the classroom. However idealistic to implement in California classrooms, this idea breathes life through the joint efforts of San Jose State''s STEM NOW and Girls Who Code organizations.<br><br><h2>STEM NOW</h2><br>STEM NOW (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics Network of Women) at San Jose State University is contributing to the advancement of STEM education by providing a supportive network for women that encourages participation to benefit members with expanded career opportunities and personal growth. STEM NOW functions to bridge the gap between middle school, high school, college, and professional level women, allowing our organization to uniquely extend support and connect the community at all stages of learning. Collaborating with Girls Who Code, STEM NOW hosts weekly workshops where middle and high school students engage in software projects with guidance from instructors and SJSU students. We hope to stimulate curiosity and excitement by providing an encouraging environment to learn and play with technologies not offered in the standard classroom. STEM NOW also organizes: forward-thinking hackathons - with at least one woman on each team; professional, cutting-edge workshops to sharpen student skills; and conference admission to learn and expand our growing network. I am so proud to participate in an organization that takes action to bridge the gender gap in STEM.<br><br>Technology plays a massive role in our day-to-day lives, advancing exponentially to connect people and solve problems. People who build technology influence and shape our world. This is why it is so important to talk about more women entering careers in STEM; having the conversation is a first step toward progress.

INSERT INTO `posts` VALUES (12,'Benefits of Open-Source Technology in Education','2014-03-03','Gianna Fusaro','Thoughts on using "open-source" principles and technology to enhance learning in the classroom and beyond.','<br><hr><br>The public education system in California desperately needs improvement. Our curriculum for mathematics and science instruction emphasizes systematic learning by reading text or being told what to know. I believe in hands-on learning; in my experience, discovery through experimentation produces the most valuable results for students. Implementing open source technology in the classroom for educational purposes can be a part of the solution to improve math and science public education. <br><br>What does open source mean and how is it valuable in the classroom? Open source software allows a user to access and modify source code. Computers and technology are an integral part of the world today, and are important learning tools. Open source software has the potential to remove the "black box" abstraction of how programs and computers work. This has several benefits to students and technology:<br><ul><li>&nbsp;</li><li>• nurtures a deeper understanding of the mechanics of software, computers and technology through examination and adjustment of source code</li><li><br></li><li>• reinforces scientific thinking by allowing curiosity, discovery and hands-on experimentation to drive comprehension</li><li><br></li><li>• promotes innovation, creativity and critical thinking with manipulation of code to create, design and build upon software</li></ul><br>Khan Academy uses the open source paradigm in their classroom. John Resig, Dean of Computer Science at Khan Academy, stated "I wanted to build off of the open source model. I wanted the code to be the front and center and not just show the graphical content, even when it is not a programming exercise".  Khan Academy has a similar setup to Github, where students can make or modify programs to create their own "spin-off" program. For example, simulation software for NASA that launches a lander into orbit provides students the ability to view source code and make changes so they can visually see what variables change what aspects of the launch. Creating connections in the brain between abstract variables and tangible visuals based on observation and experimentation encourages students to be scientists, a critical priority that public education is missing.<br><br><h4>Resources</h4><br>DeCausemaker, Remy.  “Hacking computer science education at Khan Academy.” opensource.com 1 (2014): n. pag.         <br>     Web. 2 Mar. 2014.<br><br>Herzog, Pete.

INSERT INTO `posts` VALUES (13,'Music Notes','2009-03-23','Gianna Fusaro','Essay response to the prompt: "What do you know more about than most people?"','<br><hr><br>Music is a language of raw emotion, capable of conveying and evoking any feeling imaginable. It is a tongue that touches the soul and brings warmth to the heart, and I have become quite proficient in my fluency. Anyone can listen to music, explaining&nbsp;why it commands such universal appeal; all humans share an innate attraction to music and the comfort it offers, but not all humans share the ability to animate, or even distinguish, the scattered clusters of black notes that litter sheet music. Finesse&nbsp;with expressing an intricate web of melodies and harmonies, which intertwine to create nothing short of pure magic, is a talent that few hone to perfection. Having been involved in music for twelve years, I have had the incredible opportunity to experience,&nbsp;and even extend to others, this realm of enjoyment. I have performed in several different ensembles, experimented with several different instruments and tutored at several different schools, all of which broadened my understanding of the impact that&nbsp;music can have on others.<br><br><img alt="Image title" class="fr-fin fr-dib" src="http://i33.photobucket.com/albums/d80/dazedandconfused389/ceb5c5a5-4f18-4654-b943-13c7827c8a33.jpg" width="556"><br><br>Performing any sort of fine art in front of a large gathering of fellow human beings can prompt a swarm of butterflies in anyone''s stomach. But there is no finer feeling than nailing a memorized solo and hearing the uproar of applause from not only friends&nbsp;and family who appreciated the entertainment, but complete strangers as well. For three years I participated in the CMEA, where one prepares for months in advance only to be adjudicated based on a single performance. This is where one develops an adeptness&nbsp;for being under pressure - performing takes all of the grueling practice and compiles it into one moment in time, where everything freezes. During this beautiful, frozen moment, I let go of any inhibitions and let the music surge from my clarinet, communicating&nbsp;my understanding of the piece through my instrument while persuading my audience with my performance to sense what I want them to feel. For this moment, the audience is mine - not just their attention, but their feelings. So many factors go into conveying&nbsp;emotion through song - tempo, time signature, dynamics, rhythm, embouchure, articulation - causing a myriad of interpretations for one piece, because it is entirely based on the perspective of the performer. I have played in five school bands, three&nbsp;orchestras and two pit bands, some of which had overlapping pieces, and although the music may have been identical note for note, the overall sound was entirely different because of the different conductors and their varied personal taste. Personal flair&nbsp;will always make for an indelible performance, leaving the audience with a greater or alternative insight on the opus they just experienced.<br><br>Most people cannot differentiate a flute from a clarinet simply by tone. From my experience, from the piccolo to the triangle, every instrument has a particular identity and importance within the ensemble. Each instrument embodies a different flavor that&nbsp;enriches the palate of the listener, working together to form a cohesive and compelling movement. I had realized the importance of all these individual sounds while working in the pit band, which is a small collective group of musicians - typically of&nbsp;about fifteen people - who are forced to double up on instruments due to the insufficient ratio of players to required sounds. The vast majority of folks that attend musicals are not aware of all the diligence and talent that happens beneath the stage;&nbsp;it''s rarely realized that the same musician who rendered the beautiful flute solo during the intermission also performed on the English horn, oboe, and bassoon throughout the final act. During my performance, I was constantly exchanging my clarinet,&nbsp;tenor and baritone saxophone with incredible haste and strain - the pit was crowded and cramped, and having to swap instruments whose collective weight was greater than my own at the drop of a hat (or more-so at the cue of the conductor) proved to be&nbsp;quite a challenge. And yet, with all of the quandaries we managed to trump, we still managed to receive less acknowledgement than the actors. I maintain the belief that musicians in a musical are just as integral a part of the performance as the actors&nbsp;onstage. Not only do we enhance the experience, but we provide entertainment when the thespians do not, from the opening to the grand finale and all the interludes in-between. It is astounding that an ensemble of fifteen students can successfully feign&nbsp;the sound of a fully fledged orchestra merely by the proper combination of instruments and talent.<br><img alt="Image title" class="fr-image-dropped fr-fin fr-dib" src="http://i33.photobucket.com/albums/d80/dazedandconfused389/blue-orchestra-kids.jpg" width="659"><br>Musical aptitude can be acquired through dedication and perseverance, both which are scarcely found in most fourth and fifth grade students. For three years I participated in Music Mentoring, a program in which high school students visit various elementary&nbsp;schools twice a week in an effort to aid novice students with any musical qualms they are facing. Unfortunately the clarinet, when played by a rudimentary musician, resembles a flock of clamorous geese - but the true joy is witnessing that drove of noise&nbsp;transform into a passion. The ability to strengthen a beginner''s hunger for music and then satiate their appetite, especially when their musical sphere is unexperienced and pliable, is an amazing feeling. Mentoring not only improved my own skills but&nbsp;provided the tutors with an opportunity to slather our students with any beneficial knowledge that we could offer. This allowed for a progressive movement to rise toward higher standards for future musicians of our community and a heightening of the&nbsp;capacity of our local music program in general. <br><br>Most people attempt to delve into their musical capabilities at some point in their lives, but very few reach their greatest potential which takes dedication and an absurd amount of practice, so they quit before they are able to achieve the impact it&nbsp;can encompass. Music is my obsession, and I saturate much of my free time with activities where I am able to explore my limits and expand my dimensions. I know the nuances of being one organ in the entire body of an orchestra, where the audience may&nbsp;never know the difference if you miss your double sharp in the second movement. I understand the trials and tribulations of musicians who enrich musicals with their talent, and how pleasurable watching hours of practice culminate into one production can be. I can fathom the triumph of observing a student immerse themselves into music, gaining confidence with improvement. My knowledge regarding these certain aspects of music elevates my appreciation of authentic musicians, who effortlessly capture their emotions and translate them through the art of music.
