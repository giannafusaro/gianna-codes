{"a_day_in_the_life":"A 41-piece orchestra played on this song. The musicians were told to attend the session dressed formally. When they got there, they were presented with party novelties (false noses, party hats, gorilla-paw glove) to wear, which made it clear this was not going to be a typical session. The orchestra was conducted by Paul McCartney, who told them to start with the lowest note of their instruments and gradually play to the highest. (thanks, Jes - Mason City, IA)This was recorded in three sessions: First the basic track, then the orchestra, then the last note was dubbed in.The beginning of this song was based on two stories John Lennon read in the Daily Mail newspaper: Guinness heir Tara Browne dying when he smashed his lotus into a parked van, and an article in the UK Daily Express in early 1967 which told of how the Blackburn Roads Surveyor had counted 4000 holes in the roads of Blackburn and commented that the volume of material needed to fill them in was enough to fill the Albert Hall. Lennon took some liberties with the Tara Browne story - he changed it so he \"Blew his mind out in the car.\"John Lennon stated this regarding the article about Tara Browne: \"I didn't copy the accident. Tara didn't blow his mind out. But it was in my mind when I was writing that verse.\" At the time, Paul didn't realize the reference was to Tara. He thought it was about a \"stoned politician.\" The article regarding the \"4000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire\" was taken from the UK Daily Express, January 17, 1967 in a column called \"Far And Near.\"John's friend Terry Doran was the one who completed John's line \"Now they know how many holes it takes to fill...\" Terry told him \"fill the Albert Hall, John.\"McCartney contributed the line \"I'd love to turn you on.\" This was a drug reference, but the BBC banned it for the line about having a smoke and going into a dream, which they thought was about marijuana. The ban was finally lifted when author David Storey picked it as one of his Desert Island Discs.McCartney's middle section (Woke up, got out of bed...) was intended for another song.The final chord was produced by all four Beatles and George Martin banging on three pianos simultaneously. As the sound diminished, the engineer boosted to faders. The resulting note lasts 42 seconds, and the studio air conditioners can be heard toward the end as the faders were pushed to the limit to record it.The rising orchestra-glissando and the thundering sound are reminiscent of \"Entry of the Gods into Valhalla\" from Richard Wagner's opera \"Das Rheingold,\" where after the rising glissando, Thor beats with his hammer. George Martin said in his 1979 book All You Need is Ears that the glissando was Lennon's idea. After Lennon's death, Martin seems to have changed his mind. In his 1995 book Summer of Love: The Making of Sgt. Pepper, he states that the rising orchestra-glissando was McCartney's idea. (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)This being the last song on the album, The Beatles found an interesting way to close it out. After the final note, Lennon had producer George Martin dub in a high pitched tone, which most humans can't hear, but drives dogs crazy. This was followed by a loop of incomprehensible studio noise, along with Paul McCartney saying \"Never could see any other way,\" spliced together. It was put there so vinyl copies would play this continuously in the run-out groove, sounding like something went horribly wrong with the record. Kids, ask your parents about vinyl.In 2004, McCartney did an interview with the Daily Mirror newspaper where he said he was doing cocaine around this time along with marijuana: \"I'd been introduced to it, and at first it seemed OK, like anything that's new and stimulating. When you start working your way through it, you start thinking, 'This is not so cool and idea,' especially when you start getting those terrible comedowns.\"The movie reference in the lyrics (\"I saw a film today, oh boy. The English Army had just won the war\") is to a film Lennon acted in called How I Won The War.Keith Richards named his second son Tara after Tara Brown, the Guinness heir who smashes his car in Lennon's first verse. Richard's son was premature and died soon after birth. The Beatles started this with the working title \"In The Life of...\"This is a rare Beatles song with a title that is not part of the lyrics. Another one is \"Yer Blues.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)That's Mal Evans doing the counting during the first transition from John to Paul. He set the alarm clock (heard on the recording) to go off at the end of his 24-bar count. Evans also helped with the composition of a couple of songs on the Sgt. Pepper album. Although he never received composer's credit, the Beatles did pay his estate a lump sum in the 1990s for his contributions. Evans died January 5, 1976 after a misunderstanding with the police. (thanks, Brad Wind - Miami, FL)George Martin (from Q Magazine, July 2007): \"John's voice - which he hated - was the kind of thing that would send shivers down your spine. If you hear those opening chords with the guitar and piano, and then his voice comes in, 'I heard the news today, oh boy' It's just so evocative of that time. He always played his songs to me on the guitar and I would sit on a stool as he strummed. The orchestral section was Paul's idea. We put two pieces of songs together that weren't connected in any way. Then we had that 24-bars-of-nothing in between. I had to write a score, but in the climax, I gave each instrument different little waypoints at each bar, so they would know roughly where they should be when they were sliding up. Just so they didn't reach the climax too quickly. With A Day In The Life, I wondered whether we were losing our audience and I was scared. But I stopped being scared when I played it to the head of Capitol Records in America and he was gob smacked. He said, That's fantastic. And of course, it was.\"In the original take, a 41 piece orchestra was not used. Instead, Lennon had roadie Mal Evans count to 21 in a very trippy manner and set off an alarm clock after the 21 counts. This version is on the 2nd Anthology CD, and is a very different version than the one on Sgt. Pepper. (thanks, Emery - San Jose, CA)David Crosby was at Abbey Road studios when The Beatles were recording this. In an interview with Filter magazine, he said: \"I was, as near as I know, the first human being besides them and George Martin and the engineers to hear 'A Day In The Life.' I was high as a kite - so high I was hunting geese with a rake. They sat me down; they had huge speakers like coffins with wheels on that they rolled up on either side of the stool. By the time it got the end of that piano chord, man my brains were on the floor.\" (thanks, Brian - Williamsburg, VA)The orchestral bit was used in the Yellow Submarine movie. Photos of different geographical areas were shown as The Beatles were apparently traveling in the submarine to try and find Pepperland. (thanks, donald - as, KY)When asked by Rolling Stone magazine what songs of his dad's constantly surprise him, Sean Lennon said: \"I've listened so much to that stuff that there are very few surprises. But I do think 'A Day In The Life' is always inspiring.\"American rock band Hawthorne Heights originally named themselves A Day in the Life after this song. In 2003, lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist JT Woodruff changed it to their current name.On June 18, 2010 John Lennon's handwritten lyric sheet for this song featuring corrections and alternate crossed-out lines was auctioned at New York Sotheby's. It was sold for $1.2 million to an anonymous American buyer.This was rated the greatest ever Beatles song in a special collector's edition issue by The Beatles: 100 Greatest Songs. The list was compiled to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the Fab Four's final studio album, Let It Be.There is term for the techniques The Beatles used in arranging the final chords of this song: Deceptive Cadence. Glen Burtnik, who was a member of Styx and was also in a popular Beatles tribute band, told us: \"It's an instance where the listener assumes the next chord, or melody note, will go somewhere it doesn't. Even though all the indications lead you to expecting a certain outcome, the writer/arranger intentionally surprises you by going someplace else musically. Not sure it's simple to understand, as you're conditioned to being used to the outcome.\"","a_hard_days_night":"The title was taken from an expression Ringo used to say. In a 1964 interview with DJ Dave Hull, Ringo explained: \"We went to do a job, and we'd worked all day and we happened to work all night. I came up still thinking it was day I suppose, and I said, 'It's been a hard day...' and I looked around and saw it was dark so I said, 'Night!' So we came to 'A Hard Day's Night.'\"John Lennon used the phrase \"A hard day's night\" in a his book In His Own Write before it was used as a song or movie title. He used it in the short story (more of a vignette) titled \"Sad Michael.\" An excerpt: \"There was no reason for Michael to be sad that morning, (the little wretch): everyone liked him, (the scab). He'd had a hard day's night that day, for Michael was a Cocky Watchtower.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)John Lennon wrote this song, which contains long, repeating notes that are uncommon in Pop music. Even more unusual, Lennon sang it in glissando: \"haaaard days night...\". The melody resembles the Irish folk song \"Donall Og,\" with the same pentatonic, and small glissandos. Such glissandos you even find in the English ballad \"Three Babes.\"Albert Goldman wrote in his 1980 book The Lives of John Lennon, \"The whole composition is written in mixolydic key, an old key which was abandoned in the beginning of the seventeenth century, but is maintained in English and Irish folk music.\" (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)This was the title song to the first of five Beatles movies. It got two Oscar nominations and was a hit with critics and audiences. At the time, a lot of movies were made starring musicians, but most were showcases for the singers and not very good (think Elvis movies). A Hard Day's Night was a surprise because it actually had cinematic value. It even sold well when it was released on DVD many years later.When the deal was made to make the movie, The Beatles had not yet caught on in America and there were fairly low expectations for the film, as The Beatles were thought of as a fad that would soon pass. By the time filming began, The Beatles were huge and it was clear that a lot of people would see the movie. The studio considered putting more money into the film, but they decided to stick with the original modest budget. In order to save money, it was shot in black and white.The movie presented The Beatles as four distinct personalities, which changed the way they were marketed. Previously, they were always presented as a unified group, but it became clear that fans loved seeing their differences and began to associate with them individually. The concept of focusing on individual personalities in a band continues to this day, as groups like Spice Girls and Backstreet Boys are marketed with a focus on the various traits of the members, allowing fans to get to know them better.The last song in the movie soundtrack to be composed, the motion picture was being produced when Ringo made his statement that inspired the song (original movie title: Beatlemania). Walter Shenson, who was the movie producer of A Hard Day's Night, told PBS that he said to John, \"You need to write a song that will incorporate the movie's title,\" and Shenson was amazed when John came in the very next day with the song. He thought John would labor over it for days or weeks.Phil Collins was one of the school kids brought in as extras for a scene in the movie where The Beatles perform. He didn't make the cut, but years later, the film's producer gave Collins the outtake footage with him in it and had Collins add commentary to the DVD release.Lennon sang lead and Paul McCartney sang the middle sequences. John had Paul sing the middle section because he felt Paul had the more appropriate vocal range for it. Surprisingly, he insisted on singing a higher harmonization in \"From Me To You\" only a year earlier because he said he could sing the higher stuff better than Paul. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)A journalist friend of Lennon's, Maureen Cleave, claims that she suggested a slight change to one of the lyrics for this song on the way to Abbey Road studios shortly before it was recorded. (thanks, John - London, England)The Beatles recorded this in nine takes on Thursday, April 16, 1964. It was written and recorded in a little more than 24 hours. It had to be done quickly when film name was changed from \"Beatlemania!\" to \"A Hard Day's Night.\" (thanks, Ben - Cheverly, MD)The Beatles won just four Grammy Awards in the '60s, and one of them was for this song: It won for Best Performance By A Vocal Group in 1964. The Beatles also won for Best New Artist that year.At the 2002 Super Bowl, where Paul McCartney performed \"Freedom,\" Terry Bradshaw started singing this with McCartney when Paul joined the Fox announcers on the set.The Hard Day's Night Hotel opened in Liverpool in 2003. It is next to The Cavern Club, where The Beatles played many of their early shows.A Beatles cartoon aired on ABC from 1965-1969. On each segment, the animated group (voiced by actors) would go on some kind of adventure before performing one of their songs. The very first episode was called \"A Hard Day's Night\" - when the Beatles need a quiet space to rehearse, Ringo suggests a castle, where various monsters and ghouls appear when the boys start playing. In a stroke of luck, the creatures are happy to hear the music, and The Beatles play this song while Dracula and the gang dance along.","across_the_universe":"John Lennon wrote this song after having an argument with his wife Cynthia. He said, \"I was lying next to me first wife in bed, and I was irritated. She must have been going on and on about something and she'd gone to sleep and I kept hearing these words over and over, flowing like an endless stream. I went downstairs and it turned into sort of a cosmic song rather than an irritated song... it drove me out of bed. I didn't want to write it, but I was slightly irritable and I went downstairs and I couldn't get to sleep until I'd put it on paper.\" The refrain \"Jai Guru Deva Om\" is a mantra intended to lull the mind into a higher consciousness. The words are in Sanskrit, and they mean \"I give thanks to Guru Dev,\" who was the teacher of The Maharishi. The \"Om\" at the end is the drawn out \"oooohm\" used in meditation to relate to the natural vibration of the universe. While visiting the Maharishi in Rishikesh, John purchased a set of brass bracelets with the words \"Jai Guru Dev\" imprinted on them. The bracelets are now in the possession of Julian Lennon and were on display at the \"White Feather-The Spirit Of John Lennon\" exhibit at the Beatles Story in Liverpool.This first appeared on No One's Gonna Change Our World, a charity album for the World Wildlife Fund (They're the ones who sued the World Wrestling Federation and made them stop using \"WWF\"). Bird noises were dubbed in to this version to create a nature theme.This song is often cited as an example of tensions between Lennon and McCartney over treatment of each other's songs. When The Beatles went to record it in February of 1968, both Lennon and McCartney decided they wanted falsetto harmonies on the song. No matter what he did, John said he was sounding out of tune, so Paul went outside and grabbed two \"Apple Scruffs\" named Lizzie Bravo and Gaylene Pease to add the background harmonies. John is quoted again about that, saying, \"the original track was a real piece of s--t. I was singing out of tune, and instead of getting a decent choir, we got fans from outside. They came in and were singing all off-key. Nobody was interested in doing the tune originally.\" In another interview, he said, \"The Beatles didn't make a good record of it. I think subconsciously sometimes we - I say 'we' although I think Paul did it more than the rest of us - Paul would, sort of subconsciously, try and destroy a great song... meaning we'd play experimental games with my great pieces, like 'Strawberry Fields,' which I always thought was badly recorded.\"The two young women Paul grabbed off the street to sing backup appear on the World Wildlife recording of the song, but not on the version on Let It Be.For a while, this was not going to be part of Let It Be. The album was going to be called \"Get Back\" and was supposed to be recorded in front of a live audience for a TV special, with film footage of The Beatles practicing the songs in the studio used for a companion special. When things didn't go well, they decided to scrap the TV project but use the footage for their last movie, which became Let It Be. The tapes of them practicing in the studio would be worked into an album to go with the film. The first version of the album did not include this, but when the movie was edited, it included a scene where The Beatles play this, so it was added to the album.While the Let It Be movie and album were being sorted out, The Beatles recorded their last album, Abbey Road, and then broke up. George Harrison and John Lennon asked Phil Spector to take the tapes from the Let It Be project and produce the album from them. Spector took out the bird sounds, slowed the tape down, and added an orchestra and choir. The result was a very lush arrangement using his \"Wall Of Sound\" technique.This was later recorded by David Bowie with Lennon on guitar. It appears on Bowie's 1975 album Young Americans.This was originally going to be the B-side to \"Lady Madonna,\" but \"The Inner Light\" was chosen instead. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)Paul played piano on both recordings of this song. One version for the World Wildlife Fund (with the Apple Scruff harmonies) and the other for what became the Let It Be LP, with Phil Spector adding the choir, which John really loved.In a 1971 interview with Rolling Stone, Lennon disclosed that this is one of his favorite Beatles records as, \"It's one of the best lyrics I've written. In fact, it could be the best.\" He added: \"It's good poetry, or whatever you call it, without chewin' it. See, the ones I like are the ones that stand as words, without melody. They don't have to have any melody, like a poem, you can read them.\"Fiona Apple covered this in 1999. Other notable artists to record the song include Cilla Black, Jackson Browne and Laibach. Rufus Wainwright also recorded it for the I Am Sam soundtrack.At the 2001 John Lennon tribute special at Madison Square Garden, Sean Lennon performed this with Moby and Rufus Wainwright. Moby wore one of John's shirts that Sean gave him.This was a huge influence on Liam Gallagher from Oasis. It turned him on to The Beatles and inspired him to write songs.At the 2005 Grammy awards, Brian Wilson, Alicia Keys, Tim McGraw, Bono, Stevie Wonder, Norah Jones and members of Velvet Revolver played this as a tribute to tsunami victims in Asia. The single was sold to raise money for the victims, and peaked at #22 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it the first chart appearance for the song. It also held the record for a time of the fastest selling download on iTunes.On February 4, 2008 \"Across The Universe\" became the first track to be beamed directly into space. It was transmitted through NASA's antenna in the DSN's Madrid Deep Space Communication Complex, towards the North Star, Polaris, 431 light-years from Earth. The broadcasting of the Fab Four song was done to mark both NASA's 50th birthday and the 40th anniversary of \"Across The Universe.\" Paul McCartney described the transmission as an \"amazing feat\" adding, \"Well done, NASA. Send my love to the aliens!\"This song was the title for the 2007 movie, Across the Universe, who's plot line was centered around songs by the Beatles. Across the Universe stars Jim Stirges and Evan Rachel Wood. (thanks, Breanna - Henderson, NV)","act_naturally":"Originally recorded by Buck Owens, this was a #1 Country and Western song in 1963.This song was written by Johnny Russell and Voni Morrison. Russell was a prolific Country music songwriter, and Morrison was a member of Owens' backup band. Russell's lyrics were inspired by what he told his girlfriend when she asked why he went to Los Angeles: \"They're gonna put me in the movies, they're gonna make a big star out of me.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Ringo sang lead on this. He was a fan of Country music, and this became his showcase song.The Beatles played this on their third live Ed Sullivan Show appearance. It gave Ringo a chance to sing on the show.Recorded shortly after the filming of Help!, the lyrics are about appearing in movies. Ringo went on to act in many films, fulfilling what he sang about on this.This was used as the B-side of \"Yesterday.\"In 1989, Buck Owens re-recorded this as a duet with Ringo. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","aint_she_sweet":"This was written in 1927 by songwriters Milton Ager and Jack Yellen, and it quickly became a standard. Ager wrote the lyrics for his daughter Shana, who later became an actress and political commentator named Shana Alexander.This song was first recorded in 1927 as a piano tune by Frank Banta. Some of the many artists who recorded this include Frank Sinatra, Harry James, Lawrence Welk and Gene Vincent. (thanks, Terry - Willmar, MN)The Beatles recorded this in June, 1961 in Hamburg, Germany. They played in German clubs 1960-1961, becoming much better musicians as a result.John Lennon decided to play this \"as a march,\" whereas the Gene Vincent version is much softer. A softer version can be heard on Anthology 3.Most songs The Beatles covered were '50s R\u0026B hits, but this was a 1927 pop hit that the fab four liked. (thanks, Loretta - Liverpool, England, for above 2)Pete Best played drums on this. He earned some royalties when this was released on their Anthology album. It was one of the few times he benefited from The Beatles' success.The Beatles didn't release this in the US until 1964, 3 years after it was recorded.","all_ive_got_to_do":"John Lennon wrote this in 1961 in the style of Smokey Robinson and The Miracles. It was one of 3 songs (along with \"It Won't Be Long\" and \"Not A Second Time\") that was written without McCartney for album With The Beatles. John stated: \"That's me trying to do Smokey Robinson again.\" This particular song was inspired by the Miracles song \"You Can Depend On Me.\"This was recorded on September 11, 1963 at Abbey Road studios in London. The Beatles never performed it on stage. (thanks, Roman - Vilnius, for above 2)","all_my_loving":"This was the first time Paul McCartney wrote the words to a song before the music. The song began as a poem he conceived while he was shaving one morning thinking about his girlfriend Jane Asher, who he met when she interviewed him for the magazine Radio Times. He wrote the music that night. He originally envisioned it as a country/western song.This Beatles classic was never released as a single, but it was the first song the group played on their first Ed Sullivan Show appearance: February 9, 1964. It was a historic telecast, as over 73 million people tuned in. At the time, that was the largest audience ever for a TV show.McCartney sang lead on this. His vocal was double-tracked to bring it out in the mix.George Harrison's guitar solo was influenced by Chet Atkins, one of his idols when he was learning to play.John Lennon was always fond of the grinding rhythm guitar he contributed to the studio recording. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)Three very different cover versions charted in the US in 1964: An instrumental by the Hollyridge Strings made #93, a faithful version by Jimmy Griffin hit #118, and a squeaky rendition by The Chipmunks made #134.","all_together_now":"A simple sing along song that took only 5 hours of studio time to complete, this appears at the end of the Beatles movie Yellow Submarine.In 2002, this was used in commercials for Verizon wireless. In 2009, a cover of the song by the group The Hours was used to advertise Budweiser beer.This is the only song in the movie Yellow Submarine where the Beatles actually appear in the film.John Lennon once said \"I loved it when football crowds in the early days would sing 'All Together Now.'\"OutKast's Andre 3000 recorded a cover for a 2010 Kobe Bryant Nike commercial that traces NBA history.","all_you_need_is_love":"The Beatles played this for the first time on the \"Our World\" project, the first worldwide TV special. Broadcast in 24 countries on June 25, 1967, the show was 6 hours long and featured music from 6 continents, with The Beatles representing Britain. The Beatles were supposedly recording this live during the show, but they used a prerecorded backing track and John Lennon's vocal was redone a few hours later. Eric Clapton mimed guitar on this during the special.The concept of the song was born out of a request to bring a song that was going to be understood by people of all nations. The writing began in late May of 1967, with John and Paul working on separate songs. It was decided that John's \"All You Need Is Love\" was the better choice because of its easy to understand message of love and peace. The song was easy to play, the words easy to remember and it encompassed the feeling of the world's youth during that period.\"All You Need Is Love\" was a popular saying in the '60s anti-war movement. The song was released in the middle of the Summer of Love (1967). It was a big part of the vibe.John Lennon wrote this as a continuation of the idea he was trying to express in his 1965 song \"The Word.\" John was fascinated by how slogans effect the masses and was trying to capture the same essence as songs like \"We Shall Overcome.\" He once stated, \"I like slogans. I like advertising. I love the telly.\" In a 1971 interview about his song \"Power To The People,\" he was asked if that song was propaganda. He said, \"Sure. So was 'All You Need Is Love.' I'm a revolutionary artist. My art is dedicated to change.\"Musically, this song is very unusual. The chorus is only one note, and the song is in a rare 7/4 tempo. (thanks to Dwight Rounds, author of The Year The Music Died, 1964-1972)It was not until 1983 and the publication of the in the book John Lennon: In My Life by Pete Shotton and Nicholas Schaffner that it was revealed that John Lennon was the primary composer of the song. It is typical of Lennon: Three long notes (\"love -love -love\") and the rise of excitement with at first speaking, then recital, then singing, then the climax and finally the redemption. This as opposed to McCartney's conventional verse, verse, middle part, verse or A,A,B,A. Lennon felt that a good song must have a rise of excitement, climax and redeeming. (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)Ringo's second son, Jason, was born the day this hit #1 in the US. Jason is also a drummer.n the orchestral ending, you can hear pieces of both \"Greensleeves,\" a Bach two-part invention (by George Martin) and Glen Miller's \"In The Mood.\" Royalties were paid to Miller for his contribution.McCartney sang the chorus to The Beatles 1963 hit, \"She Loves You\" at the end: \"She loves you yeah yeah yeah... She loves you yeah yeah yeah\" John Lennon's hand-written lyrics for this song sold for 1 Million pounds in the summer of 2005. Lennon left them in the BBC studios after The Beatles' last live TV appearance, and they were salvaged by an employee. (thanks, Ryan - Kansas City, MO)This begins with a clip from the French national anthem, \"La Marseillaise,\" written and composed by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle in Strasbourg on April 25, 1792. Its original name was \"Chant de guerre de l'Armee du Rhin\" (\"Marching Song of the Rhine Army\") and it was dedicated to Marshal Nicolas Luckner, a Bavarian-born French officer from Cham. It became the rallying call of the French Revolution and got its name because it was first sung on the streets by troops from Marseille upon their arrival in Paris. Now the national anthem of France, the song was also once the anthem of the international revolutionary movement, contrasting with the theme of The Beatles song. In the late 1970s, Serge Gainsbourg recorded a Reggae version \"Aux Armes et cetera,\" with Robbie Shakespeare, Sly Dunbar and Rita Marley in the choir in Jamaica, which resulted in him getting death threats from veterans of the Algerian War of Independence. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Al and Tipper Gore had this song played at their wedding. They married in 1970 and separated in 2010.George Harrison mentioned this in his 1981 song \"All Those Years Ago\" with the line, \"But you point the way to the truth when you say 'All you need is love.'\" Harrison's song is a tribute to John Lennon, who was killed in 1980.This was used in the climactic final episode of the UK sci-fi series The Prisoner, and was the entrance music for Queen Elizabeth II during the UK Millennial celebrations of 1999. It was also sung by choirs across the kingdom in 2002 during the Queen's Golden Jubilee celebration. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)In 2007, this was used in an advertising campaign for Luv's diapers with the lyrics changed to \"All You Need Is Luv's.\" While Beatles songs have been used in commercials before, notably \"Revolution\" in spots for Nike and \"Hello Goodbye\" for Target, this peace anthem shilling for diapers didn't go over well with fans who thought it sullied The Beatles legacy. The publishing rights to \"All You Need Is Love\" and most other Beatles songs are controlled by the Sony corporation and Michael Jackson, which means The Beatles cannot prevent a company from re-recording the song and using it in a commercial.When asked what his favorite lyric is during an interview with NME, John Lennon's son Sean replied: \"My list of favorite things changes from day to day. I like when my dad said: 'There's nothing you can know that isn't known/ Nothing you can see that isn't shown/ Nowhere you can go that isn't where you're meant to be.' It seems to be a good representation of the sort of enlightenment that came out of the '60s.\"","and_i_love_her":"Paul McCartney wrote most of this song, and in a 1984 interview with Playboy magazine, he stated, \"It's just a love song; no, it wasn't for anyone.\" That was probably the chivalrous thing to do, as by then he was 15 years into his marriage to Linda. When he wrote the song, he was dating an actress named Jane Asher. For a while, they were the most popular couple in England. After they broke up in 1968, McCartney married Linda Eastman and Asher became a proficient author. She runs her own business called \"Jane Asher Party Cakes.\"McCartney did write \"We Can Work It Out\" and \"Here, There And Everywhere\" about Asher. See a photo and learn more about Paul and Jane Asher in Song Images.This was one of the first pop songs with a title that starts in mid-sentence. Paul was inspired by songs such as Perry Como's \"And I Love Her So.\"Most of the songs on the album A Hard Days Night are Lennon compositions. Lennon helped out with the middle part of this song, but it's mostly the work of McCartney. Structurally, the song is fairly conventional, with a clear melody in A+A+B+A system similar to popular music from the '30s that Irving Berlin wrote. (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)Paul McCartney was the only Beatle to sing on this. Like \"Yesterday,\" it is one of just of few Beatle songs with only one vocalist.This is the second most covered Beatles song with 372 versions recorded by 1972. Their most-covered track is \"Yesterday.\"Paul always intended this to be a ballad. He felt that all of their albums, regardless of how \"rocky\" they were, should have at least one ballad \"to enrich the show.\" It's the reason he added \"Till There Was You\" to With The Beatles. The Beatles Anthology 1 album has a much faster version that includes both drums and George's 12-string electric guitar, but that wasn't the original intent.The Beatles recorded this song at the end of February 1964, in the week after returning from the United States and before the start of filming their movie A Hard Day's Night, where they perform the song. The take you hear on record is Take 21.Ringo played the bongos on this track, and George Harrison played the acoustic guitar solo.The guitar duo Santo \u0026 Johnny recorded a mellow surf instrumental version of this song in 1965 which was a huge hit in Mexico. Santo \u0026 Johnny are known for their #1 hit \"Sleep Walk.\"Despite the fact that he wrote 35% of this song (the middle eight), John Lennon called this \"Paul's first 'Yesterday.'\"This was the first Beatles recording using purely acoustic instruments.Paul once stated \"This was the first song that I impressed myself with.\"When Paul McCartney was asked during a 2014 Twitter Q\u0026A what he considers to be his favorite cover of one of his tracks, the former Beatle replied: \"There are so many that I love it's difficult to say, but Esther Phillips' version of 'And I love HIM' comes to mind.\"","and_your_bird_can_sing":"\"Bird\" is British slang for \"Girl.\" One theory is that this song is a scolding by John Lennon of his buddy Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, who loved to brag about his bird - Marianne Faithfull - who was great, green (jealous/young) and could sing. John made it clear that Mick and the Stones wear great but could never ever match up to John and the other Beatles.In the 2007 book Can't Buy Me Love, Jonathan Gould makes the case that the song was inspired by a profile of Frank Sinatra by Gay Talese that appeared in the April 1966 issue of Esquire magazine. \"Bird,\" Talese wrote, \"is a favorite Sinatra word. He often inquires of his cronies, 'How's your bird?'\"What brought the article to Lennon's attention was a press release sent by Sinatra's PR man that read: \"If you happen to be tired of kid singers wearing mops of hair thick enough to hide a crate of melons... 'Tell me that you've heard every sound there is,' crooned the world's greatest kid singer in his enigmatic reply, 'and your bird can swing. But you can't hear me. You can't hear me.'\"The original 1966 article, titled \"Frank Sinatra Has a Cold,\" can be read in Gay Talese's 2003 collection titled The Gay Talese Reader: Portraits and Encounters. (thanks, Susan - Toronto, Canada)The signature dual-harmony electric lead guitar parts were played live (without overdubbing) by Harrison and McCartney. Lennon played the rhythm in the \"D major\" position with the capo on the 2nd fret (to account for the song being in the key of E). John used the 2nd fret capo several times (\"Nowhere Man,\" \"Julia,\" \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\" to name a few). (thanks, Barry Kesten - Bellmore, NY)John Lennon said this was a throwaway song with random words of psychedelia added in designed to sound like it meant something. He considered it one of his worst songs. (thanks, Jonathon - Clermont, FL)The working title for this was \"You Don't Get Me.\" (thanks, Marcos - Fort Worth, TX)The double-tracked guitar solo rates in at #69 on the \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\" list done by Rolling Stone magazine. (thanks, Jonathon - Clermont, FL)The middle part of the song has one melody, but in three versions. which are bound together with a counterpoint melody on a giutar. Unusually, the sung-melody even has some quarter notes, for example the note behind the word \"broken\" in \"when your bird is broken...\" When Lennon finishes the middle part with singing \"I'll be around\" twice in the same melody, he changes chord when he sings it the second time, without changing the melody. (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)","another_girl":"Paul McCartney wrote this while on a 10-day holiday in Tunisia. \"Another Girl\" stands out as one of the most prototypical songs of the early Beatles formula. Here we have Paul's \"silly love song,\" a poppy-upbeat tempo, downward scale fragments, limited pitch range on guitar, and double-tracked lead vocals. McCartney could crank these out all day like McDonald's assembling Big Macs.McCartney explains that when he wrote this song, he was a guest of the British government while staying in a secluded beach-side villa at Hammamet, Tunisia. He found the tiled bathroom ideal for songwriting, due to the acoustics. However, one downside is that he had a lot of foreign dignitaries dropping by.Paul McCartney played lead guitar toward the end of this song, which was unusual as normally he was The Beatles bass player.Paul has defended songs like this one, claiming that no matter how much they sound like album filler, they had to pass \"The Beatles Test.\" Which is to say, all four members had to like the song. If even Ringo said, \"I don't like this one,\" the song got thrown out.\"Another Girl\" was recorded in one take. Afterwards, George Harrison noodled around in the studio trying to add a guitar flourish to the end of the song. But when Paul remixed it, George's track-work was lost.In the video (taken from the Beatles movie Help!) - what, exactly, is Paul doing? He's supposed to be playing the woman like a guitar? With a hover-hand over the breast region? This is as surreal as McCartney gets.","any_time_at_all":"This is one of those songs that was finished \"on the fly\" so to speak. John Lennon had it half written when they went into the studio with it and he just finished it up and recorded it there. He called it, \"An effort at writing 'It Won't Be Long'... with me shouting.\"Lennon's original draft of this song had two extra verses that he left off, the last of which started, \"I'll be waiting here all alone/Just like I've always done.\" He left them off because he felt they didn't really advance the story in the song.Lennon's handwritten lyrics were auctioned for 6000 pounds in 1988.This is one of the songs not in the film A Hard Day's Night which was written to fill out the album. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Lennon wrote 10 of the 13 songs on A Hard Day's Night. In his Playboy interview in September of 1980, he went through the entire Lennon/McCartney catalogue song by song, and stated which bits of the songs were his and which were Paul's. This was the first time we learned specifically about the songwriting breakdown between John and Paul.Albert Goldman thought in his book The Lives of John Lennon that the refrain was fantastic: \"It sounds as a pistol shot... his voice is burning in a true gospel frenzy... he had a remarkable ability to utter cries from the deep of his soul.\" (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)","ask_me_why":"This is a very formulaic love song, but it marked the first time John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote a song together at the same time. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)This was released as the B-side to \"Please Please Me,\" which was the Beatles first US single.The Beatles performed at one of their early auditions for Parlophone Records when Pete Best was still their drummer. No copy of this recording exists.A copy of the promotional single given to disk jockeys in 1964 is now a collector's item worth at least $10,000.","baby_youre_a_rich_man":"This song is about how everybody can have the things that matter, and it has nothing to do with material possessions. The Beatles were rich, but they claimed that money was not that important to them.John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote parts of this separately and combined it to make one song - something they would repeat on \"A Day In The Life.\" At one point, the song was called \"One Of The Beautiful People.\"The trumpet-like sound at the beginning is a clavioline, an amplified keyboard that acted as a crude synthesizer. Other songs that used a clavoline include \"Telstar\" by The Tornados and \"Runaway\" by Del Shannon.It was rumored that The Beatles sang \"Baby you're a rich fag Jew\" as a slur to their manager, Brian Epstein. He was rich, gay and Jewish, but The Beatles never said this was about him. Epstein died later in that year when he overdosed on sleeping pills.The Beatles started working on this song with the intention of using it on the Yellow Submarine soundtrack. It was used in the 1968 movie, but didn't appear on the soundtrack.Mick Jagger sang backup. McCartney and Lennon returned the favor by singing on The Stones' \"We Love You.\"Brian Jones, the guitarist from The Rolling Stones, played an oboe on this. A few years earlier, Lennon and McCartney gave The Stones a song called \"I Wanna Be Your Man,\" which was one of their first hits, and helped convince Mick Jagger and Keith Richards that they should write their own songs.This was released as the B-side of \"All You Need Is Love.\"Lennon played clavioline and piano on the song and George Harrison played tambourine. There is actually no guitar on this song at all. Paul played bass and piano as well.This was released in mono, but in 1971 it was remixed in stereo along with several other tracks for a German version of Magical Mystery Tour. The stereo version is the one that is now the most common. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)The comedy rap trio The Fat Boys performed this song in their 1987 movie Disorderlies.In 2010, this song was used at the end of the movie The Social Network to punctuate the raging financial success of the guys who invented Facebook. It was one of the few Beatles songs licensed to a movie in its original form, meaning the Beatles version was used. Apple Corp. is very particular about where Beatles songs are used.At one point in this song, The Beatles ask, \"How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?\" The phrase \"beautiful people\" was used a lot in 1967 as a derisive way to describe the social elite. A popular book by Marilyn Bender was published that year called The Beautiful People: a Candid Examination of a Cultural Phenomenon - the Marriage of Fashion and Society in the '60s.","babys_in_black":"This is about a man who is pursuing a woman, but the woman doesn't return the interest because she is still in mourning for her previous lover, and hence she always dresses in black. The depressing subject matter is hidden by the upbeat music. (thanks, Andy - Arlington, VA)There is speculation that the song was written about mourning the loss of Stuart Sutcliffe after he died of a sudden brain hemorrhage. The song was a 50/50 effort by both Lennon and McCartney, but started by Lennon as a response to his own mourning process (which he never really got over). The \"baby in black\" would be photographer Astrid Kircherr, who dated Sutcliffe before he died.This song uses a 6/8 time signature, similar to a waltz.This is one of several Beatles songs with a dual melody line - \"If I Fell\" is another. McCartney and Lennon sang into the same microphone, making it hard to distinguish which is the main melody line. Sheet music of the song usually displays both. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 3)This was the first 50/50 Lennon/McCartney song written since \"I Want To Hold Your Hand\" a year earlier. They wrote it together sitting practically nose to nose at John's Kenwood Estate.","back_in_the_ussr":"The story of this song begins in Hrishikesh, India, where The Beatles were on a retreat learning Transcendental Meditation from their guru, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Also on the retreat was Mike Love of The Beach Boys, who told us: \"Paul (McCartney) came down to the breakfast table one morning saying, 'Hey, Mike, listen to this.' And he starts strumming and singing, 'Back in the U.S.S.R.,' the verses. And I said, 'Well, Paul, what you ought to do is talk about the girls around Russia, Ukraine girls and then Georgia on my mind, and that kind of thing.' Which he did.So I think it was the fact I was there, which caused Paul to think in terms of Beach Boys, and then my suggestion for what to do on the bridge, he took that suggestion and crafted, like only Sir Paul can, a really great song.\"McCartney was impressed with the idea and used some Beach Boys' elements in this song: Instead of \"California Girls\" it was \"Moscow Girls.\" Plus, the definitive Beach Boy \"Oooeeeeoooo\" in the background harmonies.The title was inspired by Chuck Berry's \"Back In The U.S.A.\" The Beach Boys had been influenced by that song and also \"Sweet Little Sixteen\" to come up with \"California Girls\" and \"Surfin' U.S.A.\"Paul stated in 1968, \"In my mind it's just about a (Russian) spy who's been in America for a long time and he's become very American but when he gets back to the USSR he's saying, 'Leave it 'til tomorrow to unpack my case, Honey, disconnect the phone.' and all that, but to Russian women.\"Things were tense when they were working on this album, and Ringo walked out during recording, briefly quitting the band. Paul McCartney played drums in his place.The Beatles originally wrote this for wafer-thin actress and model Twiggy.The line \"Georgia's always on my mind\" in a play on the Ray Charles song \"Georgia On My Mind.\" It has a double meaning, since Georgia was part of the U.S.S.R.Elton John performed this song when he toured Russia in 1979, and he got a huge response. This was the year before Moscow hosted the Summer Olympics, which the United States boycotted. Elton told Q magazine: \"The first night as an encore I did 'Back In The U.S.S.R.' And they went apes--t. It was like playing 'Philadelphia Freedom' in Philadelphia. You just noticed that the people there were as ordinary and as good as the people you'd notice anywhere else.\"Billy Joel got a similar reaction when he played the song in Moscow in 1987.This song caused a controversy with conservative America, because it came out during Vietnam and the Cold War and it appeared to be celebrating the enemy.This opens with the sound of an airplane flying from left to right across the speakers. Stereo was relatively new, so this was very innovative for the time.On August 22, 1968, following an argument with McCartney over the drum part for this song, Ringo walked out on The Beatles. He flew to Sardinia for a holiday to consider his future. While there he received a telegram from his bandmates saying, 'You're the best rock 'n' roll drummer in the world. Come on home, we love you.' On his return, he found his drum kit covered with flowers. A banner above read, 'Welcome Back.'Paul McCartney told Mojo magazine October 2008 that the song's middle-eight was a spoof of the Beach Boys leading up to Pet Sounds. He added: \"The rest is (sings first bars of the melody line of the opening verse) more Jerry Lee (Lewis). And the title is Chuck Berry, Back In The U.S.A., and the song itself is more a take on Chuck. You'd get these soldiers back from Korea or Vietnam, wherever the hell, and Chuck was picking up on that. I thought it was a funny idea to spoof that with the most unlikely thing of way back in Siberia.\"There was a rumor in the Soviet Union that The Beatles had secretly visited the U.S.S.R. and given a private concert for the children of top Communist party members. They believed the song was written because of the concert. Actually, some fans still believe so. (thanks, Alex - Tomsk, Russia Federation)Paul McCartney used this as the title to an album he released only in Russia in 1989. In 2002, McCartney called his US tour the \"Back In The US\" tour.","bad_boy":"This song was written and originally recorded by Larry Williams, a black Rock singer who John Lennon admired. The song is about a rebellious kid who love Rock And Roll. The Beatles chose the song because they thought it fit them very well. (thanks, Gordo - hershey, PA)","because":"John Lennon got the idea for this song when he heard Yoko to playing Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata\" on the piano. He asked her to play it backwards, and came up with \"Because\" based on what he heard. John said, \"I was lying on the sofa in our house, listening to Yoko play Beethoven's 'Moonlight Sonata' on the piano. Suddenly, I said 'Can you play those chords backward?' She did, and I wrote 'Because' around them. The song sounds like 'Moonlight Sonata,' too. The lyrics are clear, no bulls--t, no imagery, no obscure references.\"The vocals are a 3-part harmony by Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison that was overdubbed twice, creating a 9-part harmony. This is the only Beatles song with three singers throughout. (thanks, Dwight Rounds, author of The Year The Music Died, 1964-1972)Lennon said the arrangement was terrible, but McCartney and Harrison felt this was the best track on Abbey Road.This was the first use of a Moog synthesizer on any recording. Harrison had the instrument specially made, and did his best to figure it out.The 2006 Love album, which is a soundtrack to the Beatles Cirque du Soleil show of the same name, features an a capella version of this song. The album contains 26 tracks which are made up of 130 separate recordings - some are just a chord or two, and some tracks are superimposed on other tracks. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","being_for_the_benefit_of_mr_kite":"During the filming of the video for \"Strawberry Fields Forever,\" John Lennon and Apple Records employee Tony Bramwell went into an antique shop close to their hotel. Tony says, \"John and I wandered in and John spotted this framed Victorian circus poster and bought it.\" John stated, \"'Mr. Kite' was a straight lift. I had all the words staring me in the face one day when I was looking for a song. It was from this old poster I'd bought at an antique shop. We'd been down in Surrey or somewhere filming a piece. There was a break, and I went into this shop and bought an old poster advertising a variety show which starred Mr. Kite. It said the Henderson's would also be there, late of Pablo Fanques Fair. there would be hoops and horses and someone going through a hogshead of real fire. Then there was Henry The Horse. The band would start at ten to six. All at Bishopsgate. Look, there's the bill, with Mr. Kite topping it. I hardly made up a word, just connecting the lists together. Word for word, really.\"The song's title comes from a standard 19th century phrase used in advertising testimonial performances in Britain: \"Being for the benefit of...\" All-round performer William Kite worked alongside Pablo Fanque and wire-walker/clown/trampolines the Hendersons in 1843. See the poster in Song Images.As he did with many songs he wrote, John Lennon downplayed this one. \"I was just going through the motions because we needed a new song for Sgt. Pepper,\" he said.This song was credited to Lennon/McCartney, but often assumed to be written almost entirely by John. Paul McCartney claims that he had a hand in writing it, however. \"'Mr. Kite' is such a crazy oddball song, and I have great memories of writing it with John,\" he told Rolling Stone in 2013. McCartney, who played the song on his tour that year, added that if he envisioned the song as a live number, he wouldn't have made the bass line so complicated when he composed it.This was going to come after the title track on the album, but they decided to use \"With A Little Help From My Friends,\" sung by the fictional Billy Shears, so that the concept of the album would continue.It was rumored that \"Henry The Horse\" was heroin. \"Horse\" is slang for heroin, but Lennon denied that it was a drug reference. The horse is in the poster, but his name is Zanthus. Since the name Zanthus is not very musical, Lennon used the much better sounding name of Henry, making use of alliteration. (thanks, Craig - Hudson, NH)George Harrison and Ringo Starr played harmonicas on this song along with Mal Evans and Neil Aspinall. It also featured a steam organ, which was taken from old tapes.George Martin revealed at a 2008 LA presentation for members of the National Recording Academy of Arts and Sciences one of his recording techniques for this song. The Beatles producer told engineer Geoff Emerick to cut up old tapes of organ music, threw them in the air and onto the floor and then reassembled them at random, running the new sounds concurrent with the song's main organ melody.Asked during a 2014 Twitter Q\u0026A what his favorite bassline to play is, Paul McCartney replied: \"At the moment it's 'Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!' It's challenging!\"","birthday":"According to Q magazine May 2008, the Beatles were in a rush to get to Paul McCartney's house in time to catch the rock 'n' roll movie The Girl Can't Help It. Consequently they played around with a simple Blues track rather than record anything too involved. Duly inspired after watching the movie, they completed the song back in studio that night.Paul McCartney told Mojo magazine October 2008 the story of this song: \"With 'Birthday' we had a few friends around and it was one of our party's birthday, can't remember who. Pattie Boyd was there, Terry Dolan, just a few mates. Normally we didn't have friends around to sessions so it was very unusual. We didn't know what song to do so we decided to make one up. We did what Roy Orbison had done with 'Pretty Woman' and Little Richard had started with 'Lucille,' do-do do-do do-do do-do; Roy Orbison goes, do-do do-do DO-DO DO-DO- he just changes the end a little bit. We changed basically the same riff of Lucille and Pretty Woman into Birthday- do-do do-do do-do do-do…'You say it's your birthday.'\"This was one of the last songs John Lennon and Paul McCartney collaborated on. Even though all of their songs were credited to Lennon/McCartney, many of their later songs were written separately.The unique sound of this song was not supplied by an organ or any kind of keyboard. It came from running a guitar through a Leslie speaker. Such speakers are commonly found in keyboard instruments. The speaker rotates, which is what provides the different sound. (thanks, don - rapid city, SD)There is a rumor that McCartney owns the rights to the song \"Happy Birthday.\" McCartney does own publishing rights to a lot of songs, but not that one.McCartney played an upright piano that was rigged to sound like a harpsichord.Pattie Harrison and Yoko Ono sang in the chorus.Paul Weller covered the song to celebrate McCartney turning 70. His version was made available for download on Sir Paul's actual birthday (June 18th, 2012) for one day only and it entered the UK Singles chart at #64. Proceeds from the cover went to the War Child charity.Paul played the lead guitar on this with John, as well as the piano, which was cleverly miked and fed into a Vox Defiant, a solid state amp, which featured a unique mid-range booster. You can hear the settings change throughout. (thanks, Eli - Melrose Park, PA)","blackbird":"Paul McCartney wrote this about the civil rights struggle for blacks after reading about race riots in the US. He penned it in his kitchen in Scotland not long after an incident in Little Rock, when the federal courts forced the racial desegregation of the Arkansas capital's school system.McCartney told Mojo magazine October 2008: \"We were totally immersed in the whole saga which was unfolding. So I got the idea of using a blackbird as a symbol for a black person. It wasn't necessarily a black 'bird', but it works that way, as much as then you called girls 'birds'; the Everlys had had 'Bird Dog,' so the word 'bird' was around. 'Take these broken wings' was very much in my mind, but it wasn't exactly an ornithological ditty; it was purposely symbolic.\"Only three sounds were recorded: Paul's voice, his acoustic guitar, and a tapping that keeps time on the left channel.This tapping sound is a bit of a mystery, although in the Beatles Anthology video McCartney appears to be making the sound with his foot. Some sources have claimed it is a metronome, however.The Birds were dubbed in later using sound effects from the collection at Abbey Road, where the song was recorded.This was one of five Beatles songs McCartney performed on his Wings Over America tour in 1976.Blackbird Singing is the title of a book of poems McCartney wrote.Brad Mehldau recorded an instrumental jazz version of this song in 1997.In 2002, The Doves covered this on the soundtrack to the TV series Roswell.The guitar accompaniment for this song was inspired by Bach's Bourrée in E minor for lute. This is often played on classical guitar, an instrument Paul McCartney and George Harrison had tried to learn when they were kids. McCartney told Mojo magazine October 2008: \"We had the first four bars (of the Bourrée in E minor) and that was as far as my imagination went. I think George had it down for a few more bars and then he crapped out. So I made up the next few bars, and (sings his four-note variation Bach's theme) it became the basis of Blackbird.\"Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl told Q magazine that he feels this is the greatest Paul McCartney song. He commented: \"It's such a beautiful piece of music, perfect in composition and performance, and in its lyrics and in the range of his voice. Just learning that song made me a better guitar player and gave me a better appreciation of songwriting. To me it's just musical bliss.\"","blue_jay_way":"George Harrison wrote this in a house he rented in Los Angeles on a street named Blue Jay Way. He was waiting for his friend Derek Taylor when he came up with the song.Brian Kehew, who wrote the book Recording The Beatles: The Studio Equipment and Techniques Used to Create Their Classic Albums, tells us that \"Blue Jay Way\" is the most impressive Beatles song in terms of engineering. Says Brian: \"It has phasing, flanging, it has varied speed recording, it has tape echo. They put things through Leslies, they compressed and EQed things. It's really fascinating, and it has more stuff going on with it that's more detached from traditional classical recording or a Miles Davis record. It's more Beatles-y in that way. All the tricks that The Beatles had developed with compressing instruments and with EQing things in very strange ways are present on \"Blue Jay Way.\" My favorite part of it, which is really a fascinating concept, they took the track, specifically with the vocals, and then mixed it. That mix was played backwards and recorded back into the record on the multi-track, but they played it through a Leslie speaker that's spinning in the room. So occasionally during the song you hear some backwards Leslied tracks, especially vocals, swirling in and out. It's the actual song playing backwards against itself through a Leslie and then fading up and down, which is a really creative and very strange idea. I've never heard of anyone else doing something like that.\"The line \"Don't Be Long\" is repeated 29 times.This was used in the Beatles movie Magical Mystery Tour.The vocals, organ, and drums were played on two tape machines slightly out of sync to get the phasing effect.When the ending is reversed, it sounds suspiciously like \"Paul is bloody.\" This added to the \"Paul is Dead\" hoax. (thanks, Dominic - Pittsburgh, PA)","boys":"This was originally recorded by The Shirelles, a popular female vocal quartet who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. John Lennon was a big fan of the group.Pete Best sang lead on this during live appearances, until he was fired and replaced by Ringo Starr. The song served Ringo well: he often performed it in his post-Beatles career, including on the CBS special The Beatles: The Night That Changed America, which aired on February 9, 2014 in honor of the 50th anniversary of the group's famous Ed Sullivan Show appearance.Please Please Me was recorded in one day to take advantage of The Beatles UK success. They filled the album with the singles they had released along with cover songs that were often part of their live show, which is how this made the cut. The budget for the album was 400 pounds (about $800), with each Beatle receiving a union scale pay of 29 pounds. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)\"Boys\" was written by the songwriting team of Luther Dixon and Wes Farrell. Dixon was a member of the Brill Building club cranking out songs for \"girl groups\" at the height of their popularity, and also produced songs for Elvis, B. B. King, The Jackson 5, and other hit acts. Farrell had this song as an early break, but would go on to produce songs for the Partridge Family.Although the lyrics talk specifically about boys kissing girls, not each other, the issue of gender-flipped confusion did come up. McCartney told Rolling Stone in 2005, \"If you think about it, here's us doing a song and it was really a girls' song... Or it was a gay song. But we never even listened. It's just a great song. I think that's one of the things about youth - you just don't give a s--t. I love the innocence of those days.\"In the The Rolling Stone Illustrated History Of Rock \u0026 Roll, it is noted: \"The Boy is the central mythic figure in the lyrics of girl group rock. He is shadowy: the boy who'll love walking in the rain, the fine fine boy, the leader of the pack, the angel baby. He is irresistible - and almost never macho. He is sensitive. He must be pursued. How to reach him?\" In short, just about every girl group of the '60s consistently failed the Bechdel Test, as they were songs by women targeted to women while talking of nothing but men.At the 2015 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, Ringo Starr and Green Day - who were each inducted at the event - took the stage to perform a rousing rendition of this song.","cant_buy_me_love":"Paul McCartney wrote this song. Despite rumors to the contrary, he claimed it was not about a prostitute. Rather, the song makes a simple yet profound statement on what matters most in life. The word \"Love\" appeared in many Beatles lyrics, especially in their early songs.This song was recorded on January 29, 1964 in Paris, although when The Beatles returned to Britain, George Harrison decided to overdub another lead guitar part in London. The original solo is still audible in the background. (thanks, Mark - Rotterdam, Netherlands)This was one of the Beatles songs that held the top five positions on the US chart on April 4, 1964. The others were: \"Twist and Shout,\" \"She Loves You,\" \"I Want To Hold Your Hand,\" \"Please, Please Me.\" The week after it hit #1 in the US, The Beatles had 14 songs in the Billboard Hot 100. It's also the first song to hit #1 from outside the Top 20, something that didn't happen again until Billboard began using its \"Soundscan\" method of recording sales. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)This was one of the first pop songs to start with the chorus rather than a verse. That was producer George Martin's idea.Paul McCartney sang the lead vocal. It was one of the first Beatles songs where only one member of the group sang.\"Can't Buy Me Love\" was used as the title for a popcorn movie starring Patrick Dempsey in 1987. In the film, his character goes from \"totally geek to totally chic\" by paying a popular girl to pretend they are dating. Gerardo, who sang \"Rico Suave,\" was also in the movie.This was used in the first Beatles movie, A Hard Day's Night, which was re-released in 2000. It was used to replace \"I'll Cry Instead,\" which the film's director Dick Lester thought was an inappropriate song to use when the Beatles were to break out and have some fun.This replaced \"Roll Over Beethoven\"/\"Please Mr. Postman\" as the single to be released by Capitol Records USA in March 1964.In the first two takes of this song, John and George sang back up harmonies. Take four is the one they used. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)The jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald recorded this shortly after The Beatles version came out. She covered several pop songs late in her career.Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel perform part of this song in the 2008 movie Yes Man.","carry_that_weight":"Paul McCartney wrote this about his struggle to keep the Beatles together after Brian Epstein's death. Epstein was their manager and handled their business affairs, but he became overwhelmed by the success of The Beatles and died from a sleeping pill overdose in 1967. McCartney took over most of The Beatles' business affairs, and gained a greater respect for what Epstein went through.Along with their other turmoil at the time, McCartney told Barry Miles in an interview that the emotional weight of this song also came from too many drug issues with the group, and they were having difficulties with their new manager Allen Klein. Apple Corps (no relation to the computer company) was already in dire financial straights by the time Klein took the helm. Doubtless, there was a bit of nostalgia for the time when they were four carefree mop-tops from Liverpool who could just have fun being a band without a care in the world.Another cause of strife between McCartney and manager Klein was when he brought in Phil Spector to work on the Let It Be sessions. As has been noted in many places, not the least of which his murder trial, Spector tended to rub people the wrong way.This was recorded as one song with \"Golden Slumbers.\" It is part of a suite of songs at the end of Abbey Road made up of bits of unfinished songs strung together.All four Beatles sang in the chorus. It's one of the few Beatles tracks where they all provide vocal harmony. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)The orchestral backup, comprised of session musicians, includes 12 violins, four violas, four cellos, four horns, three trumpets, a double bass, a trombone, and a bass trombone.\"Carry That Weight\" has an inserted verse of \"You Never Give Me Your Money.\" It's Paul singing solo, but double-tracked to give it harmony. And cryptic, enigmatic lyrics that nevertheless manage to evoke sadness.","christmas_time_is_here_again":"Recorded December 6, 1966 and November 28, 1967 in London, England, this song was never officially released until it appeared as the B-side to \"Free As A Bird\" in 1994. The original version was distributed to The Beatles fan club in 1967. It's the only song ever written specifically for the Beatles Fan Club members.Many upbeat Pop groups of this era like The Beach Boys and The Four Seasons released Christmas songs, but The Beatles never had an official Christmas release. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2)","come_together":"Timothy Leary was a psychologist who became famous for experimenting with LSD as a way to promote social interaction and raise consciousness. Leary did many experiments on volunteers and himself and felt the drug had many positive qualities if taken correctly. When the government cracked down on LSD, Leary's experiments were stopped and he was arrested on drug charges. In 1969, Leary decided to run for Governor of California, and asked John Lennon to write a song for him. \"Come Together, Join The Party\" was Leary's campaign slogan (a reference to the drug culture he supported) and was the original title of the song. Leary never had much of a campaign, but the slogan gave Lennon the idea for this song.After Timothy Leary decided against using this song for his political campaign Lennon added some nonsense lyrics and brought it to the Abbey Road sessions. Paul McCartney recalled in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs: \"I said, 'Let's slow it down with a swampy bass-and-drums vibe.' I came up with a bass line, and it all flowed from there.\"In a 1980 interview with Playboy magazine, John Lennon said: \"The thing was created in the studio. It's gobbledygook. 'Come Together' was an expression that Tim Leary had come up with for (perhaps for the governorship of California against Reagan), and he asked me to write a campaign song. I tried and I tried, but I couldn't come up with one. But I came up with this, 'Come Together,' which would've been no good to him - you couldn't have a campaign song like that, right?\"John Lennon was sued for stealing the guitar riff and the line \"Here comes old flat-top\" from Chuck Berry's \"You Can't Catch Me.\" The lawsuit did not come from Berry, but from Morris Levy, one of the music industry's most infamous characters (see our interview with Tommy James for more on Levy). He owned the song along with thousands of other early rock songs that he obtained from many poor, black, and unrepresented artists. Levy sued the Beatles, or more accurately, John Lennon, over the song around the time the Beatles broke up. For years, Lennon delayed the trial while he and the Beatles tried to sort out all the legal and business problems that plagued Apple Records. Finally, in an attempt to avoid the court room as much as he could (Lennon felt like he was appearing in court more often than not), he settled with Levy. In return for dropping the suit, Lennon agreed to record his Rock N Roll album, which was just a series of covers of songs Levy owned. Lennon always wanted to make a cover album and was thrilled to have the opportunity, and Levy wanted the value of his songs to increase, and when a Beatle re-records a song, that is just what happens. To make a long long long story short, Lennon recorded the album over the Lost Weekend, a year-or-two period when he was separated from Yoko Ono and lived in LA. During that time he was often drunk or high, and was rather sloppy and useless. Levy was getting frustrated with the lack of progress. Phil Spector was the producer, but in a fit of madness (which was not too unusual for Spector) he ran away and stole the recording session tapes. Levy invited Lennon to his upstate NY recording studio, and that is where he finally recorded the album. (thanks, Matthew - New York, NY)The whispered lyric that sounds like \"shoot\" is actually Lennon saying \"shoot me\" followed by a handclap. The bass line drowns out the \"me.\"The Beatles recorded this on July 21, 1969 and it was the first session John Lennon actively participated in following his and Yoko's car accident 3 weeks earlier. John was so insistent on Yoko being in the studio with him that he had a hospital bed set up in the studio for her right after the accident, since she was more seriously injured than he was. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)The line \"Ono sideboard\" refers to Yoko.The British Broadcasting Company (The BBC) banned this because of the reference to Coca Cola, which they considered advertising.This has one of the most commonly misheard lyrics in the history of popular music: \"Hold you in his -armchair- you can feel his disease.\" It's actually \"Hold you in his arms, yeah, you can feel his disease.\" All published sheet music had the \"armchair\" lyric, including the inner sleeve of the 1967-1970 compilation, which contained lots of other errors too, notably on \"Strawberry Fields Forever.\" After John heard that his lyric was incorrect in the sheet music and other folios, he decided he liked \"armchair\" better and kept it. (thanks, Mark - London, England)The Beatles released this as a \"double A side\" single with \"Something.\"In 1969, this won a Grammy for best engineered recording.When rumors were spreading that Paul McCartney was dead, some fans thought the line \"One and one and one is three\" meant that only George, John and Ringo were left. The line \"Got to be good lookin' cuz he's so hard to see\" was supposed to be Paul's spirit. (thanks, jill - placentia, CA)A rotary phone was used to make the sound heard before each verse and after the chorus. The sound was accompanied by the bass Paul played. Kids, ask your parents or grandparents what a rotary phone was. (thanks, Patrick - Tallapoosa, GA)Aerosmith recorded this song with Beatles producer George Martin for the 1978 movie Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which turned out to be one of the worst films ever made. Aerosmith appeared in the film performing this song (as the Future Villain Band), agreeing to the role only because they couldn't resist the chance to record a Beatles song with George Martin. They weren't the only big names in the film - Peter Frampton and The Bee Gees were also in it.The Aerosmith version of \"Come Together\" made #23 in the US when it was released as a single. When we asked their guitarist Brad Whitford why some folks prefer the Aerosmith version, he replied, \"I've actually never heard anybody say that.\" Whitford added, \"But you know, it's funny, I hear our version more on the radio than I do The Beatles' version.\"In 2001, Beck, Moby, Marc Anthony, and Nelly Furtado were scheduled to put on a tribute concert in Radio City Music Hall called \"Come Together: A Night For John Lennon.\" Due to the terrorist attacks on America, it was postponed and dedicated to the people of New York City, with proceeds benefiting victims of the attacks.Nortel used this in commercials, as did Macy's.On an early demo version of \"My Monkey\" by Marilyn Manson (whose vocals were sped up to sound like \"a demonic toddler\"), Manson sang the second verse as an opener. It appeared on Demos in Lunchbox by Manson's former band, The Spooky Kids.This has been covered by Michael Jackson, Tina Turner, Meat Loaf, Guns N' Roses, Soundgarden, Marilyn Manson, Nazareth, and Oasis. (thanks, Brett - Edmonton, Canada, for above 2)Though Ringo is best known for playing on Oyster Black Pearl Ludwig drum kit, he used for this his Ludwig \"Hollywood\" maple-finish equipment, with a 22\" kick. Starr produced his distinctive late '60s drum muffling sound on tracks like this by wrapping tea towels (dishtowels) around his snares and toms.The Arctic Monkeys performed the song during the London 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony. Their version reached #21 on the UK singles chart in the week after the event.","cry_baby_cry":"The lyrics were inspired by nursery rhymes and the songs Donovan was writing: Donovan's songs were \"fairy tale\" like. Donovan states, \"I think the eventual imagery was suggested by my own songs of fairy tales. We had become very close in exchanging musical vibes.\" The song was based in part by two nursery rhymes, \"Sing A Song Of Sixpence\" and \"Cry, baby, cry...stick a finger in your eye...etc.\"John Lennon said he got the title for the song from an advertisement. The original line from that advertisement was, \"Cry, baby cry. Make your mother buy.\" John told Hunter Davies (the Beatles official biographer) \"I've got another (song) here, a few words, I think I got them from an advert - 'Cry baby cry, Make your mother buy.' I've been playing it over on the piano. I've let it go now. It'll come back if I really want it.\" (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)At the very end of the song, there is a conversation between George Martin and Alistair Taylor. Here is what's said:Alistair Taylor: \"bottle of claret for you if I'd realized. I'd forgotten all about it George, I'm sorry...\"George Martin: \"Well, do next time\"Alistair: \"Will you forgive me\"?George: \"Mmmm...yes...\"Alistair: \"cheeky bitch.\"This is one of the songs begun in Rishikesh, India when the Beatles were staying with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.In the song, John mentions the \"Duchess of Kircaldy.\" Kircaldy is in Fife, Scotland and when he was young, Kircaldy was a stop that John always made when in route to visit his relations in Durness. The Beatles also performed in Kircaldy in their early years.","cry_for_a_shadow":"This instrumental is the only Beatles track to be credited to John Lennon and George Harrison alone (who play rhythm and lead respectively). It was intended as a parody of British Rock band The Shadows, whose instrumental music was enjoying unprecedented success. Whilst Harrison imitates Shadow's guitarist Hank Marvin's signature lead sound, McCartney can be heard replicating the trademark yelp of bassist Jet Harris.In a 1987 interview with Guitar Player magazine, George Harrison said: \"In Hamburg we had to play so long, we actually used to play 'Apache'... But John and I were just bulls--tting one day, and he had this new little Rickenbacker with with a funny kind of wobble bar on it. And he started playing that off, and I just came in, and we made it up right on the spot.\"This track features the original Beatles drummer Pete Best, who received some royalties from the song when it was included on the 1995 Anthology collection.This track was recorded in Hamburg whilst the Beatles performed under the moniker \"The Beat Brothers\" as a backing band for English singer Tony Sheridan. The track was produced by German big band leader and composer Bert Kaempfert.Released on Polydor Records, the label declined further recordings from The Beatles, who returned to England, whilst Tony Sheridan stayed in Hamburg. At the request of The Beatles new manager Brian Epstein, Kaempfert dissolved his contract with the band in May 1962.This was originally entitled \"Beatle Bop.\"","day_tripper":"John Lennon's lyrics were his first overt reference to LSD in a Beatles song. The song can be seen as Lennon teasing Paul McCartney about not taking acid.In 2004, Paul McCartney did an interview with the Daily Mirror newspaper where he explained that drugs influenced many of The Beatles' songs. He singled this one out as being about acid (LSD), but also said that people often overestimate the influence of drugs on their music.The line \"She's a big teaser\" was written as \"She's a prick teaser,\" but the group new that wouldn't fly.Lennon: \"Day Trippers are people who go on a day trip, right? Usually on a ferryboat or something. But the song was kind of - you're just a weekend hippie. Get it?\"A short promotional film of The Beatles lip-synching to this song was made for the TV special The Music Of Lennon and McCartney, which first aired December 17, 1965 in the UK. It was one of the first music videos. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2)Lennon wrote this after their record company demanded a new single. The Beatles were not that happy with the way this song turned out because they had been forced to come up with a new single. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)Jimi Hendrix sometimes covered this at his concerts.This was released as a double-A-sided single with \"We Can Work It Out.\" It went to the #1 position in the UK but only went to #5 in the US. In fact, \"We Can Work It Out\" got more airplay in the US. In America, the single was released on the same day as the Rubber Soul album, although neither song was on that album. The Beatles were popular enough to support the output.James Taylor did a cover version on his album Flag. (thanks, Jake - New Rochelle, NY)With a packed schedule and feverish demand for TV appearances, The Beatles made music videos for five on their songs, including this one, at a one-day shoot at Twickenham Film Studios in London on November 23, 1965. They did three different versions of \"Day Tripper,\" lip-synching the song while having fun with the set pieces.","dear_prudence":"While Mia Farrow inspired such men as Andre Previn, Frank Sinatra and Woody Allen, her sister Prudence left her mark on John Lennon. According to Nancy de Herrera's book, All You Need Is Love, Prudence met The Beatles on a spiritual retreat with the Maharishi in India, which she attended with Mia. When Prudence, suffering depression, confined herself to her room, Lennon wrote this hoping to cheer her up. It did.According to American flautist Paul Horn, who was also with them in Rishikesh, Prudence was a highly sensitive person, and by jumping straight into deep meditation, against the Maharishi's advice, she had allowed herself to fall into a catatonic state. Horn stated, \"She was ashen-white and didn't recognize anybody. She didn't even recognize her own brother who was on the course with her. The only person she showed any slight recognition towards was Maharishi. We were all concerned about her and Maharishi assigned her a full-time nurse.\" (thanks, bob - napa, CA)Prudence Farrow wanted to \"Teach God quicker than anyone else,\" according to John Lennon. She would lock herself in her room trying to meditate for hours and hours. From A Hard Day's Write, by Steve Turner: \"At the end of the demo version of Dear Prudence John continues playing guitar and says: 'No one was to know that sooner or later she was to go completely berserk, under the care of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. All the people around were very worried about the girl because she was going insane. So, we sang to her.'\"Prudence Farrow explained years later that she was just trying to take Transcendental Meditation seriously. She said in Mojo magazine, September 2008: \"They were trying to be cheerful, but I wished they'd go away. I don't think they realized what the training was all about.\" (thanks, Lennonfan11 - regawrhhrh, Iceland)Ringo had left the group as the White Album sessions got very tense, so Paul McCartney played drums. When Ringo came back a short time later, there were flowers on his drum kit welcoming him back.The guitars were overdubbed 6 or 7 times.John Lennon's handwritten lyrics were auctioned off for $19,500 in 1987.Lennon considered this one of his favorites.Siouxsie And The Banshees covered this in 1983. Their version went to #3 in the UK and became their biggest hit.This song was in the movie Across the Universe, which was based on The Beatles music. In the movie, Prudence (played by T.V. Carpio) locked herself in a closet after discovering that Sadie and JoJo were together when she thought she loved Sadie. Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), Jude (Jim Sturges), Sadie (Dana Fuges) and Max (Joe Anderson) sing this to make her feel better. It gets her out of the closet and they end the song at a anti-Vietnam War rally. (thanks, Breanna - Henderson, NV)","devil_in_her_heart":"This was originally released by The Donays in 1962 as \"Devil In Your Heart.\" The Donays were a female group from Detroit.The Donays' version became popular in England in 1963 when The Beatles put it on their second album. The British single by The Donays quickly became a collectors item.This was written by Richard P. Drapkin, who recorded under the name Ricky Dee and was on the Oriole label in Britain. (thanks, Reed - New Ulm, MN)This song was a standard part of The Beatles repertoire on their 1962 and 1963 tours.","dig_a_pony":"The Beatles recorded this on the Apple Records rooftop on the afternoon of January 30, 1969. It appears in rooftop sequence of the movie Let It Be. It was their first live performance since they stopped touring in 1965.There is a false start in this song that was caused by Ringo, as you can see Lennon looking back at him to make sure he's ready before they start again. What caused the hiccup is unclear: if you watch the clip, just as they are getting ready to count into the song, you see Ringo blowing smoke out of his mouth. There is a hesitation and you see him bending over, but it looks like he's already put his cigarette down prior to that.In the 1988 film Imagine: John Lennon, home video footage reveals Lennon being asked about several lines from this song by a young man who was found hiding on the property surrounding Tittenhurst, Lennon's home in Ascot, England. Lennon assures him that the song refers to no specific person and that the lyrics are \"nonsense,\" a lyrical technique he also attributes to unspecified Bob Dylan songs. John stated in 1969 about this song, \"I just make it up as I go along.\" (thanks, Nick - La Crosse, WI)The working title of this song was \"Con A Lowry.\" Lennon changed it because, \"'I con a Lowry' didn't sing well... it's got to be d's and p's you know.\"Lennon wrote this as 2 songs: \"All I Want Is You\" and \"Dig a Pony.\" In the original pressings of the Let It Be LP, it's listed as \"All I Want Is You.\"Producer Phil Spector cut out 2 lines for the album version. The unedited version is in the movie.This song was listed as \"I Dig A Pony\" on the album (though that error was corrected for the CD). Some people thought that the line \"Hi, hi hi, hi hiyeeee.... dig a pony\" was \"I, I, I, I Iyeeeeeeeee.... dig a pony.\" You can still find tabs online for \"I Dig A Pony.\" (thanks, Loretta - Liverpool, England)The line \"I do a road hot\" was originally \"I dig a skylight\" and then \"I did a groundhog.\"","dig_it":"This was taken from a 12 minute improvised jam session in the studio. The Beatles were planning to record the album in front of a live TV audience, with another TV special made about how the album was made. When George Harrison protested, plans for the live show were scrapped and the album was assembled from various sessions. Phil Spector was brought in to work with the tapes, and the album was finally released about a year after it was recorded.The Beatles were constantly using the phrase \"Dig it\" at this time.This appears in the Beatles movie Let It Be, which was the result of footage shot for what was going to be the TV special.This song did not age very well, and was left off the album when Apple records released Let It Be... Naked, a version of the album without Phil Spector's orchestrations. That album came out in 2003.Billy Preston played the organ. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)The original title was \"Can You Dig It,\" which John says at the end (spliced in from an earlier session) when he says \"That was 'Can You Dig It' by Georgie Wood. And now we'd like to do 'Hark The Angels Come'.\" Incidentally, George Wood was the name of the man who bought John's childhood home Mendips from his Auntie Mimi. It was also the name of a British child star.","do_you_want_to_know_a_secret":"John Lennon claimed this song came to him based on the tune \"I'm Wishing\" that his mother used to sing him from the Disney movie Snow White. In the beginning of the Disney song, Snow White is singing to the doves, \"Wanna know a secret? Promise not to tell? We are standing by a wishing well.\"George Harrison sang lead. It's one of the few Beatles songs not sung by the person who wrote it.This was the first Lennon/McCartney song to be a hit for another artist - it was recorded by Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas. Their version was #1 in England for 2 weeks.The Beatles were very close to a record deal, and John wanted to marry. Their manager Brian Epstein was very upset as he had been pitching the boys as 4 good-looking single chaps from England. John could not be talked out of the wedding so Brian made him a deal. As the 2 could not afford a honeymoon, and did not have a place of their own, he would let them use his flat for 2 weeks, with the promise that they not tell anyone they were married. In the flat on their honeymoon, for obvious reasons, John wrote \"Listen, do you want to know a secret?\" John has said that the secret in question wasn't necessarily that he was married, but that he finally realized he was actually in love. (thanks, Ken - Hartland, MI)Lennon said in interviews 1971 and 1980 that he wrote this song in time for his wedding in August 1962. Most Beatles tracks were credited to Lennon/McCartney, and while the band was together, they rarely discussed who actually wrote what songs, so it wasn't until after their break-up that Lennon revealed he was the composer of this song. (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)George Harrison said in Musician magazine that the musical inspiration for the song came from \"I Really Love You\" by the group The Stereos.","doctor_robert":"This is about Doctor Robert Freymann, a \"Speed Doctor\" in New York who supplied many celebrities, including The Beatles, with drugs. Reportedly, Dr. Freymann, who died in 1987, treated patients with injects of amphetamine-spiked vitamin B-12 from his Manhattan East 78th Street clinic. It should be noted that most Americans, due to diet and convenience culture, suffer from a vitamin B deficiency, and so an infusion of B vitamins feels like a \"pick me up\" all by itself, which is why many popular \"energy drinks\" (Red Bull, Monster, etc.) have this in the ingredients.The Beatles recorded this on Sunday, April 17, 1966. Two days later, they chose Take 7 to overdub all the vocals. (thanks, Ben - Cheverly, MD)John Lennon did indeed peg this song as autobiographical, stating in interviews that he was the one who carried a pocket full of pills on tour. However, both he and Paul McCartney deny going to this specific doctor, but say that this song was kind of a piss-take at the idea, which struck them as funny.John's vocals are double-tracked and then split into two slightly out-of-phase stereo channels to simulate a trip on drugs. Also, the pivot to the key of B during the bridge gives a sudden blissful shot to the song.","dont_bother_me":"This was George Harrison's first recorded song. It was his response to critics who claimed he was not an important member of the group because he did not write songs.Harrison never regarded this song very highly, stating, \"I don't think it's a particularly good song... It mightn't even be a song at all, but at least it showed me that all I needed to do was keep on writing, and then maybe eventually I would write something good.\"A Harrison-penned song would not appear again until the 1965 album Help!. That would be \"You Know What To Do.\"This song has a darker, more pessimistic mood that was uncommon of The Beatles main sound, but would come to be Harrison's trademark stamp. This is actually part of what made the Beatles' formula work: McCartney was the chirpy, positive one, and Harrison was the melancholic counterpart.George wrote this when he was down with the flu in a hotel room in the Northeast of England. The Beatles chauffeur kept various tapes which the band were working on. Years later these were sold off at one of the London auction houses. This song in it's very earliest stages is available on bootleg and features George working the music and lyrics out as he goes along. George stated, \"I wrote the song as an exercise to see if I could write a song. I was sick in bed. Maybe that's why it turned out to be 'Don't Bother Me.'\" (thanks, John - London, England)For your information, the photography technique for the cover of With The Beatles, in which the Fab Four's headshots hover in a half-moon, light-and-shadow effect, is called \"chiaroscuro.\" It's an Italian word to describe the Renaissance technique of dramatically contrasted lighting effects in oil paintings.This was the first song on Side 2 of Meet The Beatles, their first album released in the US. With The Beatles was their second UK release.George Harrison may have thought very little of this song, but his friend Tom Petty didn't share this sentiment. \"I thought it was just the coolest song, like nothing I'd heard in rock,\" Petty told Rolling Stone in 2014. \"I'd say, 'Well, I like it. A lot. If you did that today, I'd say it was really good.' And he'd go, 'Well, you'd be wrong.'\"","dont_let_me_down":"John Lennon dedicated this song to Yoko One. It was the first song he wrote for Yoko, who he married on March 20, 1969.Released as the B-side of \"Get Back,\" this song was recorded the same day. It was going to be on the Let It Be album, but when the tapes from the sessions were turned over to Phil Spector to produce, he took it out.This was one of the songs The Beatles played at their impromptu rooftop concert in 1969. The concept of the album was The Beatles performing new songs for a live audience, with film footage of their rehearsals used to make a documentary TV special. George Harrison didn't like the idea, and when things got tense during recording, he left the sessions and returned only after they agreed to cancel the live performance. The Beatles were still under contract to make another movie, so they decided to use the rehearsal footage as their last movie, Let It Be. In order to end the movie, they needed a big scene, so they went to the roof of Apple Records and started playing. John Lennon forgot some of the words to this song while the Beatles were playing their rooftop concert. (thanks, Jonathon - Clermont, FL)Billy Preston, who The Beatles met when he was on tour with Little Richard in 1962, played keyboards on this track. Preston was one of the few outside musicians (excluding members of orchestras) to play on any Beatles song. George Harrison brought him in to smooth tensions in the studio. He did the same thing during The White Album sessions, when he brought in Eric Clapton. The presence of a musician The Beatles respected had a way of making them put aside their differences.When Apple Records remixed the album Let It Be and released it in 2003 as Let It Be... Naked, this was included. An alternate take was used. It was the only song on the new album that did not appear on the original.Lennon asked Ringo to crash his cymbals loudly to \"give me the courage to come in screaming.\"Billy Corgan's band Zwan covered this. They rearranged the entire song so only the melody was the same. They added a guitar solo at the end. Others artists to cover the song include Randy Crawford, Crown of Thorns, Dylan \u0026 Clark, Garbage, Gene, Marcia Griffiths, Taylor Hicks, Julian Lennon, Annie Lennox, Maroon 5, Matchbox Twenty, The Persuasions, Phoebe Snow, Stereophonics and Paul Weller. (thanks, SJ - skalj, Denmark)Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson is from Edinburgh, and in 1999 they played this song at the opening of the newly-elected Scottish Parliament, which was celebrating autonomy after 300 years of British rule. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","dont_pass_me_by":"Ringo Starr wrote this and sang lead. It was the first Beatles song he wrote by himself.Ringo wrote this song in 1963. In an interview for a New Zealand radio station during their 1964 tour of Australia, Ringo is heard in the background saying \"sing the song I've written, just for a plug.\" Then, Paul says \"Ringo has written a song called 'Don't Pass Me By.' A beautiful melody. This is Ringo's first attempt at songwriting.\" At this point, Paul and John actually sing a verse of it and Ringo says, \"It was written as a country western, but Paul and John singing it with that blues feeling has knocked me out. Are the Beatles going to record it? I don't know. I don't think so, actually. I keep trying to push it on them every time we make an album.\" Paul then states, \"Unfortunately, there's never enough time to fit Ringo's song on an album. He never finished it.\" Ringo put the finishing touches on it while in Rishikesh, India.The original title was \"Some Kind of Friendly.\"This was #1 hit in Scandinavia.","drive_my_car":"Laden with sexual innuendo, this song is about a guy who meets an aspiring actress, who tells him he can \"drive my car,\" as she has a keen interest in him, and might even be in love.She keeps trying to lure him in (\"I can show you a better time\"), but when he finally agrees to take the job, she admits that she doesn't have a car, but still wants him to be her driver. It's pretty clear that all this driving talk is leading to sex, but there's no proof that it isn't just a song about a guy, a girl, and a car - making it another radio-friendly Beatles track.By this time, John Lennon and Paul McCartney were writing more songs separately, but this one was an equal collaboration, with Lennon writing most of the lyrics and McCartney coming up with the melody.Originally, it was a very different song lyrically, with the chorus, \"I can give you golden rings, I can give you anything, baby, I love you.\" Knowing that storyline would lead them nowhere good, they hashed it out until they came up with \"Drive My Car\" for the title, and changed the song so it was the woman soliciting the man.Paul McCartney played bass, piano and lead guitar on this one; George Harrison played guitar and did backing vocals. John Lennon sang lead with McCartney and also played tambourine.The \"beep beep\" refrain is a take-off on The Beatles own \"yeah, yeah yeah\"s in \"She Loves You\" as well as a nod to The Playmates song \"Beep Beep\" (a #4 US novelty hit in 1958).Paul McCartney played this at halftime of the 2005 Super Bowl. The year before, Janet Jackson exposed a breast on live TV, which caused a great deal of controversy. McCartney was a solid choice because he was unlikely to offend anyone.At the 2005 Live 8 Concert in London, McCartney performed this in a duet with George Michael.The title of the album comes from \"plastic soul,\" a derogatory phrase McCartney had overheard black musicians using about Mick Jagger. (\"Plastic\" in those days meant anything fake or processed.) Paul can be heard using the phrase in studio chatter on June 14, 1965, during recording of the \"Help!\" B-side \"I'm Down.\" Reliably, he put his own spin on the phrase. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2)","eight_days_a_week":"This fades up from silence. It was the first pop song to do so.There are two possibilities on where the title came from. In Bob Spitz' The Beatles: The Biography, Paul McCartney claims that he asked his chauffeur (while being driven to John's house in Weybridge) if he was busy, and got the answer \"Busy? I've been working eight days a week.\" In a later interview, Paul says that it was Ringo who coined the phrase: \"He said it as though he were an overworked chauffeur. When we heard it we said 'Really?' Bing! Got it\"! John Lennon also claimed it was one of Ringo's malapropisms.The Beatles wrote this for the movie Help, which was at one point titled \"Eight arms to hold you.\"McCartney wrote most of this song, while Lennon added the middle eight and a few other lines. Usually John and Paul sang lead on songs that they wrote or principally wrote. This is an exception to that, with Paul writing the song but John singing lead. (thanks, Carl - Eugene, OR)In the first few takes of this song, the John Lennon and Paul McCartney harmonized an opening rather than having the song begin with the guitar. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)John Lennon claimed not to like the song. In his 1980 interview with Playboy magazine, he stated, \"'Eight Days A Week' was never a good song. We struggled to record it and struggled to make it into a song. It was [Paul's] initial effort, but I think we both worked on it. I'm not sure. But, it was lousy anyway.\"This was not released as a single in the UK. It was scheduled for release there until Lennon wrote \"I Feel Fine.\" It was immediately changed to the new song.Artists to cover this song include The Dandy Warhols, Joan Jett, Lorrie Morgan, The Persuasions, Billy Preston and Procol Harum. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Both this song and \"You Won't See Me\" lift the chord sequence from The Four Tops' \"It's the Same Old Song.\" McCartney later admitted, \"we were the biggest nickers in town.\"This song was used in the movie My Best Friend's Wedding, and also in an episode of the TV show Scrubs.","eleanor_rigby":"Paul McCartney wrote most of this song. He got \"Rigby\" from the name of a store (Rigby and Evens Ltd Wine and Spirit Shippers) and \"Eleanor\" from actress Eleanor Bron. He liked the name \"Eleanor Rigby\" because it sounded natural.McCartney explained at the time that his songs came mostly from his imagination. Regarding this song, he said, \"It just came. When I started doing the melody I developed the lyric. It all came from the first line. I wonder if there are girls called Eleanor Rigby?\"McCartney wasn't sure what the song was going to be about until he came up with the line, \"Picks up the rice in a church where a wedding has been.\" That's when he came up with the story an old, lonely woman. The lyrics, \"Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door\" are a reference to the cold-cream she wears in an effort to look younger.\"Father Mackenzie\" was originally \"Father McCartney.\" Paul decided he didn't want to freak out his dad and picked a name out of the phone book instead.A string section scored by Beatles producer George Martin consisting of four violins, two violas and two cellos were used in recording. Paul may have been inspired by the classic composer Vivaldi.The Beatles didn't play any of the instruments on this. All the music came from the string players, who were hired as session musicians.Paul McCartney (from Observer Music Monthly November 2008): \"When I was a kid I was very lucky to have a real cool dad, a working-class gent, who always encouraged us to give up our seat on the bus for old people. This led me into going round to pensioners' houses. It sounds a bit goody-goody, so I don't normally tell too many people. There were a couple of old ladies and I used to go round and say, 'Do you need any shopping done?' These lonely old ladies were something I knew about growing up, and that was what 'Eleanor Rigby' was about - the fact that she died and nobody really noticed. I knew this went on.\"There is a gravestone for an Eleanor Rigby in St. Peter's Churchyard in Woolton, England. Woolton is a suburb of Liverpool and Lennon first met McCartney at a fete at St Peter's Church. The gravestone bearing the name Eleanor Rigby shows that she died in October 1939, aged 44. However Eleanor was not like the lonely people in McCartney's song, as she was married. Another of the gravestones there has the word \"McKenzie\" written on it. McCartney has denied that that is the source of the names, though he has agreed that they may have registered subconsciously.This was originally written as \"Miss Daisy Hawkins.\" According to Rolling Stone magazine, when McCartney first played the song for his neighbor Donovan Leitch, the words were \"Ola Na Tungee, blowing his mind in the dark with a pipe full of clay.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)The lyrics were brainstormed among The Beatles. In later years, Lennon and McCartney gave different accounts of who contributed more of the words to this.Microphones were placed very close to the instruments to create and unusual sound.Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin both had hits with cover versions of this.Because of the string section, this was difficult to play live, which The Beatles never did. On his 2002 Back In The US tour, Paul McCartney played this without the strings. Keyboards were used to compensate.This song was not written in a normal chord, it is in the dorian mode - the scale you get when you play one octave up from the second note of a major scale. This is usually found in old songs such as \"Scarborough Fair.\" (thanks, Rachel - Bath, England)Vanilla Fudge covered this in a slowed-down, emotional style. They've done this with many songs, including hits by *NSYNC, and The Backstreet Boys. Their version of \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" was a #6 US hit in 1968. Says Fudge drummer Carmine Appice: \"Most of the songs we did, we tried to take out of the realm they were in and try to put them where they were supposed to be in our eyes. 'Eleanor Rigby' was always a great song by The Beatles. It was done with the orchestra, but the way we did it, we put it into an eerie graveyard setting and made it spooky, the way the lyrics read. Songs like Ticket To Ride, that's a hurtin' song, so we slowed it down so it wouldn't be so happy. We would look at lyrics and the lyrics would dictate if it was feasible to do something with it or not.\" (Thanks to Carmine for speaking with us about this song. His website is carmineappice.net.)Former US President Bill Clinton has stated that this is his favorite Beatles song. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)In 1966, this song took home the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Pop Vocal Performance, Male. It was awarded to Paul McCartney. (thanks, Tommy - Flower Mound, TX)In August 1966, the long-defunct British music magazine Disc And Music Echo asked Kinks frontman Ray Davies to review the then newly released Revolver album. This is how he reacted to this song: \"I bought a Haydn LP the other day and this sounds just like it. It's all sort of quartet stuff and it sounds like they're out to please music teachers in primary schools. I can imagine John saying: 'I'm going to write this for my old schoolmistress'. Still it's very commercial.\"See the statue of Eleanor Rigby in Song ImagesThe chorus of this song was sampled as part of Sinead O'Connor's 1994 song \"Famine,\" which is based on the story of the potato famine in Ireland. (thanks, Annabelle - Eugene, OR)In 2008 a document came to light that showed that McCartney may have had an alternative source for the Eleanor Rigby name. In the early 1990s a lady named Annie Mawson had a job teaching music to children with learning difficulties. Annie managed to teach a severely autistic boy to play \"Yellow Submarine,\" on the piano, which won him a Duke of Edinburgh Silver Award. She wrote to the former Beatle telling him what joy he'd brought. Months later, Annie received a brown envelope bearing a 'Paul McCartney World Tour' stamp. Inside was enclosed a page from an accounts log kept by the Corporation of Liverpool, which records the wages paid in 1911 to a scullery maid working for the Liverpool City Hospital, who signed her name \"E. Rigby.\" There was no accompanying letter of explanation. Annie said in an interview that when she saw the name Rigby, \"I realized why I'd been sent it. I feel that when you're holding it you're holding a bit of history.\"When the slip went up for auction later that year, McCartney told the Associated Press: \"Eleanor Rigby is a totally fictitious character that I made up. If someone wants to spend money buying a document to prove a fictitious character exists, that's fine with me.\"This was released simultaneously on August 5, 1966 on both the album Revolver and as a double A-side with \"Yellow Submarine.\"The thrash band Realm covered this song on their 1988 album Endless War. It is a speed metal version of the song that got them signed to Roadrunner Records. (thanks, Ben - Phoenix, AZ)McCartney told Q magazine June 2010 that after recording the song, he felt he could have done better. He recalled: \"I remember not liking the vocal on Eleanor Rigby, thinking, I hadn't nailed. I listen to it now and it's… very good. It's a bit annoying when you do Eleanor Rigby and you're not happy with it.\"","every_little_thing":"Many sources say that John Lennon played the 12-string Rickenbacker opening signature lick, as well as the solo, since George Harrison showed up at Studio Two a couple of hours after the initial tracking was recorded. Some believe John \"borrowed\" George's guitar, which was already set up in Studio Two, while others claim it was George on the electric 12-string. (thanks, Barry Kesten - Bellmore, United States)In a departure from their standard instrumentation, a timpani (kettle drum) is used on the refrains. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)This was intended to be a single, but ended up just an album cut.","everybodys_got_something_to_hide_except_me_and_my_monkey":"John Lennon described this song as, \"About me and Yoko. Everybody seemed to be paranoid except for us two, who were in the glow of love.\" According to Mojo magazine, Lennon had recently been piqued by a cartoon that portrayed Yoko as a monkey clinging to her Beatle lover's back and took 'monkey' as his pet name for Ono.This has the longest title of any Beatles song.The backing track was sped up to give a frantic pace.The line, \"Come on, Come on, its such a joy\" was something the Maharishi said while The Beatles were in India in 1967. The original title of this was \"Come On, Come On.\"This was covered by Fats Domino. Lennon really loved his cover.John Lennon played lead guitar on this one. George Harrison is playing rhythm guitar.","everybodys_trying_to_be_my_baby":"Carl Perkins was the first to record this. The Beatles also covered Perkins' \"Matchbox\" and \"Honey Don't.\"So, to track down the pedigree of this song: It was written by Carl Perkins, a Memphis, Tennessee rockabilly artist, but it's also very similar to another song by the same title by Alabama country singer Rex Griffon - while using music more keeping with \"Blue Suede Shoes.\" Meanwhile the melody was also borrowed back to country by Hank Williams in the songs \"Move It On Over\" and \"Mind Your Own Business.\" The melody was also re-borrowed for \"Rock Around The Clock.\" Confused now?George Harrison sang lead - he was a huge fan of Perkins. It was his showcase song on early tours. The technique used for George Harrison's vocals, in which they are both double-tracked and echoed to create a fuller sound, goes by the acronym STEED, for \"Single Tape Echo + Echo Delay.\" For that 1950s \"rocker from outer space\" effect.This was the last Beatles album to which George Harrison did not offer any lyrical contribution. After Beatles For Sale, he became more prominent as a songwriter in the group - he wrote 2 songs for Help and 2 for Rubber Soul. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)Ironically considering the album title, Beatles For Sale was not for sale in the United States until the 1980s. The album Beatles '65 contained mostly the same tracks, and was the US version of the UK Beatles For Sale.","fixing_a_hole":"Paul McCartney wrote this after fixing the roof on his farm in Scotland. McCartney said the song was \"about the hole in the road where the rain gets in, a good old analogy.\"This was the first time The Beatles used a studio other than one owned and operated by their record label EMI. The takes in this new studio - Regent Sound Studio, located in Tottenham Court Road, London - were numbered 1-3. They returned to Abbey Road the next day however, recording \"A Day In The Life.\" (thanks, Matt - Lancaster, PA)It was rumored that this was about heroin, as in \"getting a fix.\" There is no truth to this rumor.George Harrison became annoyed at the number of times Paul re-recorded vocals for this song, later saying he did almost nothing during the recording of the album but sit around all day listening to Paul singing the words \"Fixing a hole\" all day. (thanks, Jonathon - Clermont, FL)","flying":"All four Beatles are credited with writing this song. It was the first song where composer credits were shared by the whole group.This was the first instrumental song by The Beatles to be published by EMI. It was also the only Beatles instrumental released on Parlophone Records, their British label. They had recorded an instrumental for Rubber Soul called \"12-Bar Original\" in 1965, which went un-released.The Beatles used this in their movie Magical Mystery Tour.This is one of the few Beatles songs featuring the Mellotron, which was played by John Lennon. Others are \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"I am the Walrus.\" (thanks, Mike - Mountlake Terrace, Washington, for all above)The original title was \"Aerial Tour Instrumental.\" (thanks, Morgan - Fargo, ND)","for_no_one":"Paul McCartney wrote this song sitting in a chalet while on holiday with his girlfriend Jane Asher in Klosters, Switzerland, March of 1966. The working title was \"Why Did It Die,\" and there is speculation that McCartney wrote the song about Asher, who was a successful London actress. The theory is that Paul wanted her to cater to his schedule, tour with him, and be the \"perfect Beatle wife,\" but Jane had a life and career of her own, hence the \"She doesn't need you\" lyrics. Paul has never said it was about Jane specifically, however he did say, \"I guess there had been an argument. I never have easy relationships with women.\" He knew what he was getting into when he got involved with Jane, and being that the song was written in 1966 and they didn't break up until 1968, it's likely that if the song was about Jane, it wasn't a serious argument.When he heard the title, Alan Civil, who played the French Horn on this, thought this was an orchestral piece called \"For No. One\" (thanks, chet - saratoga springs, NY)This was recorded on May 9, 16 and 19, 1966 by only two Beatles - Paul singing and playing the keyboard and bass, and Ringo on percussion. (thanks, Dominic - Pittsburgh, PA)Maureen McGovern recorded this and \"Things We Said Today\" as a 2-song medley for her 1992 album Baby I'm Yours.McCartney used this in his 1984 movie Give My Regards to Broad Street.Revolver was the last Beatles album to have different US and UK versions. In 2002, Rolling Stone readers voted it the greatest album of all time. The album cover was created by artist Klaus Voormann, who became friends with the band when they were playing clubs in Hamburg, Germany in the early '60s. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","for_you_blue":"George Harrison wrote this. It was inspired by his wife, Pattie.A little after half way through the song, John Lennon makes a reference to Elmore James, a Blues musician: \"Elmore James got nothin' on this.\" If you listen to the song \"Madison Blues\" by Elmore James, the tune is very similar to \"For You Blue.\" (thanks, Ben - Encinitas, CA)John Lennon played the slide guitar part. The Beatles performed this in their last movie, Let It Be, and Lennon can be seen using a shotgun shell for the slide.The version on Anthology 3 and also the Let It Be... Naked album are different takes from earlier in the January 25, 1969 session (1/25/69) when this was recorded. The Naked version is the same one seen in the Let It Be film. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Harrison played this on his 1974 Dark Horse tour.This hit #1 along with \"The Long and Winding Road,\" which was its A-side. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)This was originally titled \"George's Blues.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","free_as_a_bird":"John Lennon recorded this as a demo in 1977. The other Beatles recorded around his tracks to complete song in 1994. The next year, it was released as a single.Jeff Lynne of The Electric Light Orchestra produced this. Ringo Starr and George Harrison both played on E.L.O.'s 2001 album Zoom. Lynne had quite a task on this song, as Lennon's original vocal was mixed with the piano track.Yoko Ono agreed to release Lennon's demo to the other Beatles the day after he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Yoko got a bad rap by a lot of Beatles fans, but she has been very protective of Lennon's legacy. This is one of the few projects she has authorized on his behalf.Before their breakup, The Beatles won just four Grammy Awards, but they picked up three more in 1997 when \"Free As A Bird\" won for Best Pop Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal and Best Music Video, Short Form, and Anthology won Best Music Video, Long Form.Some royalties were donated to a Romanian AIDS charity set up by Elton John and the Beatles' wives.The phrase \"Turned out nice again\" at the end of the song is a reference to George Formby, a musical hall entertainer who played the ukulele and is represented in the closing scenes of the video. \"Turned out nice again\" was Formby's catchphrase. The connection here is that George Harrison played the ukulele and was a member of the George Formby Appreciation Society. He even attended their gatherings. Harrison was said to have had a ukulele in every room of his home and gave one to McCartney early on in their career. (thanks, PJ - Glasgow, Scotland)McCartney told Observer Music Monthly that they put some backward recordings at the end of the single as a joke, \"To give all those Beatles nuts something to do.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)While locked up in Wormwood Scrubs prison for breaching a probation order, the controversial rock vocalist Pete Doherty claimed he listened to this song every day.","from_me_to_you":"The title was taken from a letters column that ran in a popular British music newspaper called The New Musical Express (the NME). The column was called \"From You to Us.\"When this same newspaper refered to \"From Me to You\" as \"Below-par Beatles,\" it upset John Lennon, who talked about it in his last print interview before his death when he told Rolling Stone: \"Maybe it wasn't as good as 'Please Please Me,' but below par? I'll never forget that one. That's when I first realized you've got to keep it up, there's some sort of system where you get on the wheel and you've got to keep going around.\"In 1963, Del Shannon became the first American to cover a Beatles song when he recorded a version of \"From Me to You.\" The Beatles version was released first (May 6, 1963), but Shannon's version was the first to chart, when it entered on June 29, eventually peaking at #77. It wasn't until the first week of August that The Beatles version \"bubbled under\" on the Billboard charts, and it wasn't until the song was rereleased in February 1964 during the peak of Beatlemania that it cracked the Hot 100, going to #41 in the States.As for Del Shannon, his career waned when The Beatles and other British groups came to the US, and he was never able to regain the popularity he had in 1961, when he had a hit with \"Runaway.\" Suffering from depression, he killed himself in 1990.This was the first song to feature The Beatles falsetto \"whoooo.\" This was a big part of many of their early hits, including \"I Want To Hold Your Hand.\" Paul McCartney learned the \"whoooo\" from listening to Little Richard.This was rewritten and used as a theme song for a radio program featuring the Beatles called \"From Us to You.\" It ran in England from December 1963 to June 1965.John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote this on a bus while The Beatles were touring with Helen Shapiro, a 16-year-old who was more popular in America at the time then they were. They wrote the song as a message to The Beatles' fans.This song was released as an A-side single in the UK (the B-side was \"Thank You Girl\"). In the US, it was released as the B-side of \"Please Please Me.\" The song didn't appear on an album until after The Beatles broke up.This was one of the songs The Beatles performed on The Ed Sullivan Show when they came to America in February 1964. This was the start of Beatlemania in America, and it got a big boost from the show, which had an enormous audience. The Beatles played it on their second appearance, which came a week after their first.Structurally, this is an unusual song as it is in a major chord (C), but ends on a minor (A minor). This was very rare in the world of pop music. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","get_back":"Early versions include the line \"I dig no Pakistanis.\" The song began as a commentary about immigration, telling people to \"Get Back\" to their own countries. It was meant to mock Britain's anti-immigrant proponents. Paul McCartney thought better of it and made the lyrics more obscure. (thanks, Brad Wind - Miami, FL)A live version on the Apple rooftop ended the movie Let It Be. This is what The Beatles were playing on the Apple rooftop when the police shut them down. The album version is a studio take with the end of the rooftop concert spliced on, complete with comments to make it sound live.\"Get Back\" was going to be the title of the album. The concept was The Beatles \"getting back\" to their roots and playing new songs for a live audience without any studio tricks. This song came closest to capturing that spirit, but the album became something completely different when they decided to scrap the idea of a live album. Glyn Johns, who engineered the sessions was asked to put the album together from what were really rehearsal tapes. After he put the album together, it sat around while the Let It Be Movie was being edited from the film footage of The Beatles rehearsing in the studio and playing on the rooftop. During this time, The Beatles made the Abbey Road album, released it, and broke up. John Lennon had Phil Spector produce his solo song \"Instant Karma,\" which Harrison played on. They liked Spector's work and asked him to produce the Get Back album, which was re-titled Let It Be. Spector took the tapes and added orchestrations using his \"Wall Of Sound\" technique, and the album that was supposed to be the raw sound of The Beatles returning to their roots was released as a highly-produced final album after they had broken up.In their early days, The Beatles played in clubs for hours most nights, but by 1967, they stopped touring. This single was advertised as \"The Beatles as nature intended.\"At the beginning of the album version, Lennon sang, \"Sweet Loretta fat she thought she was a cleaner, but she was a frying pan.\" He was making fun of the first line in the song.At the end of the album version, Paul says \"thanks Mo\" in response to Ringo's wife, Maureen, who was clapping.The press release to promote the single contained this quote from McCartney: \"We were sitting in the studio and we made it up out of thin air... we started to write words there and then... when we finished it, we recorded it at Apple Studios and made it into a song to roller coast by.\"Lennon claimed this was basically a rewrite of their 1968 song \"Lady Madonna.\"The single version is longer than the album version. Usually it is the other way around.Paul looked at Yoko in the studio when he sang the line \"get back to where you once belong.\" John thought he was disrespecting her.McCartney got the idea for this from the line, \"Get back to where you should be,\" which came from a song Harrison wrote called \"Sour Milk Sea,\" which was eventually recorded by Jackie Lomax. McCartney changed the line to, \"Get back to where you once belonged.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)There was speculation that the character \"JoJo\" was based on Joseph Melville See Jr., Linda McCartney's first husband, who was from Tucson, Arizona. McCartney denied this, explaining in his 1988 autobiography Many Years From Now, that he and Linda were on good terms with See, who used the first name Melville, and that \"JoJo\" was \"an imaginary character, half-man and half-woman.\" See never remarried, and in 2000 he killed himself in Tucson.Billy Preston played piano and became the only guest artist to get a credit on a Beatles single when this was credited to \"The Beatles with Billy Preston.\" After George Harrison left the sessions, he saw Preston in concert with Ray Charles. The Beatles met Preston in 1962 when they were both playing in Germany, but they hadn't seen each other since. Harrison asked Preston to come by the studio the next day, where he played on this and \"Don't Let Me Down.\" Having him in the studio eased the tension and made it easier for The Beatles to put personal conflicts aside and record the album.The last version of the song, which can be heard in the widely bootlegged \"rooftop sessions,\" finds McCartney mocking the police as they shut down the rooftop concert. You can hear him ad-lib the lines \"You been out too long, Loretta! You've been playing on the roofs again! That's no good! You know your mommy doesn't like that! Oh, she's getting angry... she'll have you arrested! Get back!\"Some of the artists to cover this song include: The Bee Gees, The Crusaders, Dizzy Gillespie, Al Green, Elton John, The London Symphony Orchestra, The Main Ingredient, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Billy Preston, Kenny Rogers, The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, The Shadows, Status Quo, Rod Stewart, Ike and Tina Turner, and Sarah Vaughan. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2)In 2003, Paul and Ringo gave permission to Apple Records to rework the album and remove Phil Spector's production. The result is the stripped down version called Let It Be... Naked, which McCartney claims is what the group intended.McCartney played this at halftime of the 2005 Super Bowl. It was the year after Janet Jackson exposed her breast during the halftime show.","getting_better":"The idea of \"Getting Better\" came to Paul McCartney while he was walking his dog, Martha. The sun started to rise on the walk and he thought \"it's getting better.\" It also reminded him of something that Jimmy Nichol used to say quite often during the short period when he was The Beatles drummer. This song was a true collaborative effort for Lennon and McCartney, with Lennon adding that legendary part about being bad to his woman. He later admitted to being a \"hitter\" when it came to women. He said \"I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself, and I hit.\"John Lennon had a bad acid trip during the recording. While doing the overdubs, John began to get very sick. He said, \"I suddenly got so scared on the mike. I thought I felt ill and I thought I was going to crack. I said I must get some air.\" George Martin took him up on the roof of the studios for air and John started walking towards the edge. Martin panicked, thinking that John would fall or leap off and that would be it. On the roof, when John saw Martin looking at him \"funny,\" he realized he was on acid. John decided he couldn't do any more that night, so he sat in the booth and watched the others record. Paul eventually took him home and stayed to keep him company, and he decided to drop some acid with John. It was Paul's first LSD experience.George Harrison played the tamboura, a large Indian string instrument. It is the droning noise about 2/3rds of the way through.The string sound at the end was Beatles producer George Martin hitting the strings inside a piano.Lennon contributed the pessimistic viewpoint, coming up with the line, \"It can't get no worse.\" McCartney usually wrote much happier lyrics than Lennon.Lennon revisited this song when he used the lyrics, \"Every day, in every way, it's getting better and better\" for his 1980 track \"Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy).\" This time, instead of taking the cynical side, he was affirming that life does just get keep getting better and better. (thanks, Leigh - NY, NY)This was used in commercials for Phillips television sets in 1999. The living Beatles resent the use of their songs in advertisements, but cannot prevent it because they do not own the publishing rights; Michael Jackson does.The Beatles had stopped touring by the time this was released. The first time McCartney played it live was on his 2002 \"Back In The US\" tour. That tour was made into a CD and a 2-hour concert film that aired on ABC and was released on DVD.This was used in the 2003 movie The Cat in the Hat starring Mike Myers. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)","girl":"John Lennon: \"This was about a dream girl.\" His wife Cynthia thought this song might have been about her. (thanks, Mike - Mountlake Terrace, WA. U.S.A)As a joke, George Harrison and Paul McCartney repeated \"tit\" on the backing vocals. Most people don't notice it or think they are singing something more innocent.This was one of John Lennon's favorite Beatles songs. He revealed in the January 1971 edition of Rolling Stone, that in this song he was, \"in a way, trying to say something or other about Christianity\" which he was \"opposed to at the time.\" He explained: \"I was just talking about Christianity in that - a thing like you have to be tortured to attain heaven. I'm only saying that I was talking about 'pain will lead to pleasure' in 'Girl' and that was sort of the Catholic Christian concept - be tortured and then it'll be alright, which seems to be a bit true but not in their concept of it. But I didn't believe in that, that you have to be tortured to attain anything, it just so happens that you were.\"Jackson Browne said in Rolling Stone magazines 100 Greatest Singers Of All Time issue: \"There was a tremendous intimacy in everything John Lennon did, combined with a formidable intellect. That is what makes him a great singer. In 'Girl,' he starts in this steely, high voice: 'Is there anybody going to listen to my story.' It's so impassioned, like somebody stepping from the shadows in a room. But when he comes to the chorus, you suddenly realize: He's talking directly to her. When I heard this, as a young teenager, it hit the nail on the head. It embodied the feelings I was living with every day - completely burning with sexual desire, with almost a regret at being so overpowered.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","glass_onion":"John Lennon used meaningless lyrics to confuse people who were reading too much into his songs. He got a kick out of people trying to analyze his lyrics.A glass onion is a coffin with a see-through lid. Because of this, it became a big part of the \"Paul is Dead\" hoax. Another clue for those who believed the hoax: Lennon sang, \"The Walrus is Paul.\" In many European countries, a walrus represents death. (thanks, Dominic - Greensboro, NC)Lennon mentioned other Beatles songs in the lyrics: \"Strawberry Fields,\" \"I am the Walrus,\" \"Lady Madonna,\" \"The Fool on the Hill,\" and \"Fixing a Hole.\"Lennon wanted to name one of the bands they signed to Apple Records \"Glass Onion.\" They chose \"Badfinger\" instead.One theory is that \"Glass Onion\" refers to Lennon's opinion of the yogic concept of the lotus with its layered petals (layers of consciousness to be stripped away, much like an onion, through meditation) as a bunch of transparent bull used by the Maharishi to manipulate and seduce. He's also saying the Maharishi's whole shtick stinks and is a crying shame. (thanks, ELBUSH - Greensboro, NC)When Lennon sings about the \"Cast Iron Shore,\" he's referring to what was an area of beach at Liverpool, that is now partly built over. This area of Liverpool is called Otterspool. (thanks, Murray - Liverpool, England, England)According to Mojo magazine, the Beatles recorded 34 takes of the song's basic rhythm track on Wednesday September 11, 1968, then returned the next day to overdub Lennon's vocal and again on Friday and the following Monday for further overdubs. On October 10th George Martin, after returning from holiday, added the string section.Paul McCartney had the original idea for writing a song that had a poke at all those who read too much into the Beatles lyrics. McCartney came up with its structure and he and Lennon wrote it roughly 50-50.Lennon explained to Rolling Stone in a 1971 interview why he said \"The Walrus is Paul.\" Said Lennon: \"'I Am The Walrus' was originally the B side of 'Hello Goodbye.' I was still in my love cloud with Yoko and I thought, well, I'll just say something nice to Paul: 'It's all right, you did a good job over these few years, holding us together.' He was trying to organize the group, and organize the music, and be an individual and all that, so I wanted to thank him. I said 'the Walrus is Paul' for that reason. I felt, 'Well, he can have it. I've got Yoko, and thank you, you can have the credit.'\"","golden_slumbers":"This song was based on a 17th century poem by Thomas Dekker called Golden Slumbers Kiss Your Eyes:Golden slumbers kiss your eyesSmiles awake you when you riseSleep, pretty wantons, do not cryAnd I will sing a lullabyRock them, rock them, lullabyCare is heavy, therefore sleep youYou are care, and care must keep youSleep, pretty wantons, do not cryAnd I will sing a lullabyRock them, rock them, lullabyPaul McCartney wrote this on his stepsister's piano. He saw the song \"Golden Slumbers\" in her songbook and, unable to read music, made up his own using most of the original lyrics.According to Mark Lewisohn's The Beatles Recording Sessions, McCartney recorded this song on July 2, 1969, a day after Lennon suffered injuries from a car accident in Scotland that left him in a hospital until July 6th. So Lennon did not perform on this song. George Harrison played bass guitar as Paul was playing piano.Recorded as one song with \"Carry That Weight,\" this is part of a suite of songs at the end of Abbey Road. It was the last album The Beatles recorded, although it was released before Let It Be.","good_day_sunshine":"Paul McCartney wrote this on a sunny day at John Lennon's house. It was influenced by the Lovin' Spoonful, who had a happy hit with \"Do You Believe In Magic?\"The actual Lovin' Spoonful hit which inspired this song was \"Daydream,\" a famously carefree, upbeat tune. McCartney confided in interviews that it was intended to evoke \"the same traditional, almost trad-jazz feel\" and that \"Good Day Sunshine\" was Paul's effort to write something in the same spirit.The song was recorded over two days, with the first day being the bass, piano, and drums picked best out of three takes, then the lead vocals (Paul, George, and John) dubbed over that. On day two, Ringo added more drums, producer George Martin added the piano solo on a tape recorder running a step slower so it would sound sped-up, and more harmonies and hand claps were added.An early use of stereo, the chorus bounces between the left and right channels at the fade.Covers for this song include Claudine Longet, who charted with it in 1967 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and the Scottish singer Lulu on her 1970 album Melody Fair. McCartney himself also rerecorded it for his 1984 film Give My Regards to Broad Street.Rolling Stone ranks Revolver at #3 on its 2003 list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time,\" second only to the Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds. \"Good Day Sunshine\" received a lot of praise individually from critics, even out of all that.This song is a popular pick for the wake-up music on space station missions. In November 2005, McCartney himself played it live to the crew of the ISS. Guess you might as well have a sunny, happy number to start your day when you're crammed into living space the size of a bus surrounded by infinite vacuum.Ringo can be heard to mutter something here on the final verse, right after Paul's \"she feels good\" line.","good_morning_good_morning":"John Lennon watched a lot of TV. He wrote this after hearing \"Good Morning, Good Morning\" in an ad for Corn Flakes.The animal sounds were dubbed in from a sound effects disc. They were arranged in order of creatures capable of eating the one before, at Lennon's request.George Martin edited the chicken at the end to go right into the guitar of the Sgt. Pepper reprise. One of the innovations of the album was the songs blending together.Lennon: \"It's a throwaway, a piece of garbage.\"The lyrics, \"it's time for tea and Meet the Wife\" refer to the BBC sitcom Meet The Wife, starring Freddie Frinton and Thora Hird. (thanks, Dan - Indianapolis, IN)","good_night":"This is the final track on The White Album, which was a double album released in the UK in November 1968. It's a tender ballad written by John Lennon and sung by Ringo Starr, whose voice suited the song's mood perfectly. It was completed with a lush score by Beatles producer George Martin, who also conducted the orchestra of 26 musicians. Along with the Mike Sammes Singers choral overdubs it was all consigned to the oxide particles in a late night session in Studio 1 at Abbey Road on July 22, 1968.Many have thought this was a Paul McCartney song due to its gentle nature, but it does show John could write for the two opposite ends of the spectrum from the rockers like \"Revolution\" to the gentle \"Julia.\" (thanks, David - Wolverhampton, United Kingdom, for above 2)John Lennon wrote this lullaby for his son, Julian, who did not discover this was written for him until 12 years after it's release on The White Album.Ringo sang this accompanied by a 30 piece orchestra and a choir. He is the only Beatle to appear on the song. The Orchestra was scored by Beatles producer George Martin.Paul McCartney recalled in Many Years From Now by Barry Miles: \"I think John felt it might not be good for his image for him to sing it but it was fabulous to hear him do it, he sang it great. We heard him sing it in order to teach it to Ringo and he sang it very tenderly. John rarely showed his tender side, but my key memories of John are when he was tender, that's what has remained with me; those moments where he showed himself to be a very generous, loving person. I always cite that song as an example of the John beneath the surface that we only saw occasionally... I don't think John's version was ever recorded.\"This song demonstrates some similarities between John Lennon and the composer Richard Wagner. The transition from Lennon's chaotic \"Revolution 9\" to his light \"Good Night,\" sounds very much like the end of \"Die Götterdämmerung,\" where you hear dark and chaotic orchestra music that changes fashion and ends with a little conventional melody.With its long notes, depth and melancholy, this resembles Lennon's \"If I Fell.\" If you sing \"If I Fell\" very, very slowly, the melody to \"Good Night\" will appear. (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm, for above 2)Coldplay played the song at the end of their concerts in 2005 while they waved goodbye and exited the stage. (thanks, Bri - Chelmsford, MA)","got_to_get_you_into_my_life":"This song is about marijuana. Paul McCartney cleared this up in his 1998 book Many Years From Now when he explained that it was not about a particular person, but his desire to smoke pot.Session musicians played trumpets and sax. It was the first time horns were used in a Beatles song.Earth, Wind \u0026 Fire recorded a funky new version for the 1977 movie Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Beatles producer George Martin was in charge of the music, and the soundtrack was a success, but the movie, which starred Peter Frampton, The Bee Gees and Aerosmith, was a huge flop. Earth, Wind \u0026 Fire's version of this hit #9 in the US.This didn't chart until 1976, when it was released as a single backed with \"Helter Skelter.\"John Lennon thought this was some of McCartney's best work.In the '60s, Joe Pesci was an aspiring singer known as Joe Ritchie. He recorded a version of this that can be found on Rhino's \"Golden Throat\" Series. His version merits the \"Stick to Acting\" award. (thanks, Barry Kesten - Bellmore, United States)","happiness_is_a_warm_gun":"The title came from an article in a gun magazine John Lennon saw. \"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\" was the slogan of the National Rifle Association. It struck Lennon as \"fantastic, insane… a warm gun means you've just shot something.\"This complicated song, which involved various different time signatures, (the 6/8 middle section was made more convoluted by Ringo continuing to drum in 4/4), took 15 hours and over 100 takes to nail. The first half of one take was combined with the second half of another to form the complete song.Like the composer Wagner, Lennon felt that a song must have increasing excitement, climax and redemption. The song is built from pieces of several different little songs, with different melodies and rhythms, and one after another, the excitement is increasing. The climax is the falsetto, and finally the redemption is in the continuing call and answer.When The White Album was released in 1968, it was not commonly known that Lennon was a composer, as many people thought that he was only a lyric writer. After The Beatles broke up, their individual songwriting contributions were revealed in greater detail. (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)Lennon said of this song: \"It's sort of a history of rock 'n' roll.\" Much of the imagery in the lyrics is about his sexual passion for Yoko.Lennon considered this one of his favorites. It's also Paul McCartney's favorite song on The White Album.In the last section of the song, the backing vocals are \"Bang, Bang, Shoot, Shoot.\" (thanks, Dan - Riverside, CT)A popular theory is that Lennon meant for this to be a drug metaphor for doing heroin:-\"Needing a fix\"-\"Jump the gun\" meaning to cook it up-\"Bang, Bang, SHOOT, SHOOT\"-\"When I hold you in my arm, nobody can do me no harm\" - heroin addicts tell how when you're on it, nothing can do you no harm and Lennon's overall nature seem to point to this. (thanks, Matt - Edgewood, KY)This was banned by the BBC for sexual symbolism. They thought the gun was a phallic symbol.The original line \"When I hold you in my arms and feel my finger on your trigger...\" appears in unreleased, bootlegged versions of \"I'm So Tired\" as \"When I hold you in your arms, when you show me each one of your charms, I wonder should I get up, and go to the funny farm.\" This could mean the line was originally sexual but was put in as a metaphor for a gun later on. (thanks, Conrad - Los Angeles, CA)The final Doo-Wop chorus of this song has the exact same chord progression as \"This Boy,\" just in a different key.Tori Amos covered this on her 2001 album Strange Little Girls. All the songs on the album were written by men - Amos took on different characters to interpret them from a woman's point of view. Yoko Ono had to approve this, and she did.The Breeders covered this on their 1990 album Pod. (thanks, Melissa - Madrid, IA)This is the song that inspired 2Pac to cast his gun as his girlfriend in \"Me and My Girlfriend\": \"She's the only woman I need!\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","hello_goodbye":"Paul McCartney wrote this. His friend Alistair Taylor, who was visiting McCartney, asked Paul one day how he wrote his many songs, and how he came up with his ideas. Paul took him into his dining room to give him a demonstration of his hand-carved harmonium. As an experiment, Paul asked Taylor to shout out the opposite of whatever he sang, such as black and white, yes and no, hello and goodbye, etc. From this, the song was born.John Lennon hated the song. He viewed it as an inconsequential song of McCartney's, saying it was \"three minutes of contradictions and meaningless juxtapositions.\" What further infuriated Lennon was that his \"I Am The Walrus,\" was issued as the B-side to McCartney's A-side \"Hello Goodbye.\" (thanks, gavin - hampden, MA, for above 2)This is a song about how people are always different in what they say and do. (thanks, Tom - Syracuse, NY)The Beatles made a music video for this, but at the time they were called promotional films. It was banned by the BBC because Paul was clearly lip-synching, which was against The British Musician's Union's rules.Shortly after this was released, McCartney explained, \"The answer to everything is simple. It's a song about everything and nothing. If you have black you have to have white. That's the amazing thing about life.\"The ending where all The Beatles sing, \"Hela, hey, aloha,\" was improvised in the studio. This part plays over the end credits of the Magical Mystery Tour movie. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2)The working title was \"Hello, hello.\"There is a fake ending on this song that drove disk jockeys nuts, as the sound of dead air made them think the song had ended before they were ready.Target used this in commercials with the lyrics changed to \"Hello, Good Buy.\" The Beatles do not control the publishing rights for most of their songs and cannot keep them from being re-recorded and used in ads.In 2008, Jonas Brothers recorded the song for a new Target commercial.When Paul McCartney played a show in Tel Aviv, Israel on September 25, 2008, he opened with this song. It was the first time a Beatle performed in the country. Ofer Lichtman, who covered the show for The Times of Malta, wrote: There is still a debate regarding the true reason behind declining The Beatles' arrival to perform in Israel. The common story behind it was simply the lack of money and the prudence of the Israeli government. Due to Israel's poor economical situation in the 60's the organizers and promoters could not come up with the sufficient funds that were claimed and when they appealed to the Israeli Government for help, they were turned down because \"The Beatles were a threat on the morality of the youth.\"43 years later, earlier this year, the Israeli Government has sent its ambassador in Britain to officially apologize to Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and to the relatives of John Lennon and George Harrison for its unfortunate decision. After weeks of nerve racking anticipations and contradicting headlines, Paul jumped on the stage in Tel Aviv in front of an audience of 50,000 people and gave us an outstanding night to remember and a story to tell our children and grandchildren. After all those years Paul has desided to come and play in Israel in spite the many life threats he got from extreme Islamic groups.In 2009 The Performing Rights Society announced this as the most ever played Beatles song in public places in the UK. One of the reasons for this is that this was the first Beatles single release after BBC Radio 1 started broadcasting and the station played this song endlessly.California power pop band Hellogoodbye took their name from this song.","hello_little_girl":"This song was written by John Lennon in 1957 and was performed at an audition at Decca Records on January 1, 1962. It is the first original Lennon song. (thanks, Ryan - London, England)Lennon based this on songs that his mother used to sing to him.The song was originally intended to be Merseybeat band Gerry \u0026 The Pacemakers follow-up to their hit \"How Do You Do It.\" However Gerry Marsden and his crew instead went for \"I Like It,\" so their fellow Liverpudlian combo The Fourmost grabbed it for their debut single. Released on 30 August 1963, it reached #9 on the UK singles chart.","help":"This was used as the title song to Beatles' second movie. The original title to the song and the movie was \"Eight Arms To Hold You.\" The first copies of the single said it was from the movie \"Eight Arms to Hold You.\"John Lennon has described this time of his life as his \"fat Elvis period.\" In a 1971 interview with Rolling Stone, Lennon said this is one of his favorite Beatles records, because, \"I meant it - it's real.\" He added: \"The lyric is as good now as it was then. It is no different, and it makes me feel secure to know that I was that aware of myself then. It was just me singing 'Help' and I meant it.\"Paul McCartney helped Lennon write the song, but did not realize it was actually Lennon calling for help until years later.Along with \"Yesterday,\" this is one of two Beatles US #1 hits with just one word in the title.The Beatles sped up the tempo to make it more commercial, Lennon intended it as a slow song.In 1985, this became the first Beatles song ever used in a commercial when it was used in an ad for Ford cars. Ford paid $100,000 for it, and the version in the commercial was performed by a sound-alike group.The Beatles banged out a music video for this song (four others were shot the same day) so they could distribute it to television stations in lieu of personal appearances. In typical Beatles fashion, it is an irreverent clip, with Ringo Starr using an umbrella to protect from fake snow.George Harrison played a 12-string guitar on this track.The Help! movie was used by The Monkees to prepare for their TV series. The Beatles showed off their individual personalities in their movies, which The Monkees made sure to emulate. By not presenting all members of the band as identical, it made the Beatles even more popular, as many of their fans picked a favorite.There are different lyrics on the album and single versions.The lyrics appear to be addressed to another person, but they could also be seen as being addressed to a mind-altering substance. There are lots of clues in the lyrics but the major ones are, \"I've changed my mind\" and \"I've opened up the doors\" as in \"The Doors Of Perception\" which is the title of a book by Aldous Huxley about his mind altering experiences with mescaline. The title is taken from a quote of William Blake's, \"If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, infinite.\" (thanks, Ed - Perth, Australia)Originally, the album cover showed The Beatles spelling out the word \"Help\" using the semaphore system of communicating with flags, which was usually used by ships. The photographer didn't like the pose, so he had them hold the flags in a way that looked good, but didn't spell anything.Artists who covered this include Bananarama, Count Basie, the Carpenters, Tommy Castro, The Charles River Valley Boys, The Crusaders, The Damned, Howie Day, DC Talk, Deep Purple, Extreme, Jad Fair, John Farnham, Jose Feliciano, The Four Tops, Henry Gross, John's Children, R. Stevie Moore, The Newbeats, Dolly Parton, David Porter, Isaac Scott, Peter Sellers, Michael Stanley, The Tremeloes, Tina Turner, U2 and Caetano Veloso. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2)Deep Purple recorded this on a demo that helped them get a record deal in 1968.","helter_skelter":"Paul McCartney wanted to write the \"loudest, nastiest, sweatiest rock number we could\" after reading a Pete Townshend interview describing a Who track (possibly \"I Can See For Miles\") as \"The most raucous rock 'n' roll, the dirtiest thing they'd ever done.\" This was the result. Some historians of popular music now believe that this song was a key influence on the development of heavy metal.McCartney told Mojo magazine October 2008: \"Just reading those lines (of the Townshend interview) fired my imagination. I thought, Right, they've done what they think was the loudest and dirtiest; we'll do what we think. I went into the studio and told the guys, 'Look, I've got this song but Pete said this and I want to do it even dirtier.' It was a great brief for the engineers, for everyone- just as fuzzy and as dirty and as loud and as filthy as you can get it is where I want to go. I was happy to have Pete's quote to get me there.\"The first version was a 27-minute jam that was never released. During the July 18, 1968 sessions, The Beatles recorded this version, which was much slower and much more tame than the album version. Another recording from the same day was edited down to 4:37 for The Beatles Anthology, Volume III. For the album version, recorded September 9, 21 takes of approximately 5 minutes each were recorded, and the last one is featured on the official LP.In December 1968, Charles Manson heard this song, as well as others from The White Album, and interpreted them as a warning of an approaching race war. He saw the Beatles as the four angels mentioned in the New Testament book of Revelation and believed their songs were telling him and his followers to prepare themselves. Manson referred to this future war as \"Helter Skelter,\" and tried to ignite it by sending his followers to invade two homes and murder the inhabitants, making it look like the work of the Black Panthers.The word \"Pig\" was written in blood at the crime scenes, and the phrase \"Healter Skelter\" (a misspelling of the Beatles song) was scrawled at the second home, the one belonging to The Labiancas. Because of this connection, Los Angeles assistant District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi, who led the prosecution of Manson and the other killers, named his best-selling book about the murders Helter Skelter. Bugliosi's book was the basis for a film of the same title.In an interview with Lennon in the January 1971 edition of Rolling Stone, the former Beatle was asked about his reaction to Manson's deluded interpretation of this song. Lennon replied: \"He's balmy, like any other Beatle-kind of fan who reads mysticism into it. We used to have a laugh about this, that or the other, in a light-hearted way, and some intellectual would read us, some symbolic youth generation wants to see something in it. We also took seriously some parts of the role, but I don't know what 'Helter Skelter' has to do with knifing somebody. I've never listened to the words, properly, it was just a noise.\"As for Manson, he disputed Bugliosi's interpretation of the Helter Skelter theory he used to prosecute the case, telling Rolling Stone, \"that doesn't even make insane sense.\" (thanks, Mike - Mountlake Terrace, Washington, for above 2)Ringo played the drums so forcefully that his shout of \"I've got blisters on my fingers!\" accompanies the musical fadeout. Ringo explained what happened in The Miami Herald June 29, 2008: \"The track was actually very long, and we were just pounding. It was a jam, really, it turned into that. And at the end, the only way off the kit was, 'Look, my fingers are bleeding, and I just have to get up.'' And I decided to shout it.\" (thanks, William - Miami, FL)The song is named after a slide at a British amusement park. The first line is a joke about this: \"When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide, where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride.\" Learn more about the ride in Song Images.The recording session was particularly raucous.Don McLean mentions this in his song \"American Pie\" (\"Helter Skelter in a summer swelter\"), a rather clear reference to the Manson family killing spree. (thanks, Mike - Mountlake Terrace, WA. U.S.A)In 2006, McCartney played this on the Grammy Awards. It was the first time he performed on the Grammys. On his 2010 tour, McCartney included it on the setlist. McCartney's lead guitarist Rusty Anderson explained how it got in the set: \"I was working on Paul for 'Helter Skelter' since the first time we played the Super Bowl, before we even went on tour (in 2002 A.D.). I said 'Hey, y'know what would be a really rad song to play, Paul?' He said 'what?' I said 'Helter Skelter,' and he goes (imitates McCartney) 'Oh, yeah' (laughs). It took him a while to warm up to it. And we kept prodding him and prodding him and he put it in the set -- but we still hadn't rehearsed it. We said, 'Paul are we gonna rehearse 'Helter Skelter?' And finally we did it... and I remember playing it at rehearsal and some of the pre-show dancers started coming out and dancing and rocking to it and all of a sudden he started realizing how great it is.\" (thanks, DeeTheWriter - Saint Petersburg, Russia Federation)","her_majesty":"Originally intended to be an actual tribute to the Queen of England, this song was supposed to be placed in between \"Mean Mr. Mustard\" and \"Polythene Pam\" on the side two Abbey Road medley, but Paul McCartney had it removed because he didn't like it. Abbey Road studios engineer John Kurlander explains: \"We did all the remixes and cross-fades to overlap the songs, Paul was there, and we heard it together for the first time. He said 'I don't like 'Her Majesty,' throw it away,' so I cut it out - but I accidentally left in the last note. He said, 'It's only a rough mix, it doesn't matter,' in other words, don't bother abut making a clean edit because it's only a rough mix. I'd been told never to throw anything away, so after he left, I picked it up off the floor, put about twenty seconds of red leader tape before it and stuck it onto the end of the edit tape. The next day, down at Apple, Malcolm Davies cut a playback lacquer of the whole sequence and, even though I'd written on the box that 'Her Majesty' was unwanted, he too thought, 'Well, mustn't throw anything away, I'll put it on at the end.' I'm only assuming this, but when Paul got that lacquer he must have liked hearing 'Her Majesty' tacked on the end... We never remixed 'Her Majesty' again, that was the mix which ended up on the finished LP. This is why 'Her Majesty' doesn't have a final guitar chord - it lays unheard, at the beginning of 'Polythene Pam.' And the jarring electric guitar chord that begins 'Her Majesty' is actually from the end of the original 'Mean Mr. Mustard.'\"This is the shortest Beatles song. It is 23 seconds long.McCartney recorded this before the other Beatles arrived in the studio.There were no references to this song on the first pressings of the Abbey Road LP, not even on the record label. It's generally agreed that the unlisted song on the earlier pressings was the first ever hidden track to grace the world of rock.","here_comes_the_sun":"George Harrison wrote this in Eric Clapton's garden using one of Clapton's acoustic guitars. When the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein died in 1967, the band had to handle more of their accounting and business affairs, which Harrison hated. He wrote this after attending a round of business meetings. This song was inspired by the long winters in England which Harrison thought went on forever.In the documentary The Material World, Eric Clapton talked about writing this song with Harrison: \"It was one of those beautiful spring mornings. I think it was April, we were just walking around the garden with our guitars. I don't do that, you know? This is what George brought to the situation. He was just a magical guy... we sat down at the bottom of the garden, looking gout, and the sun was shining; it was a beautiful morning, and he began to sing the opening lines (to \"Here Comes the Sun\") and I just watched this thing come to life.\"The music begins on the left channel and gradually moves to the right as Harrison's vocal begins.The instrumental break is similar to \"Badge,\" which Harrison helped Clapton write for his band Cream.John Lennon did not play on this. Around this time, he was making a habit of not playing on Harrison's compositions as the two were not on the best of terms. The two eventually settled their differences as George contributed quite a bit to Lennon's album Imagine two years later. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)Harrison sang lead vocals, played acoustic guitar and used his newly acquired Moog synthesizer on this track. It was one of the first pop songs to feature a Moog.In 2006, this was voted by the members of the GeorgeHarrison.com forum as their favorite song of his.In 1976, a cover by Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel was a #10 hit in the UK.Richie Havens covered this in 1971. The Beatles' version never charted, but his hit #16 in the US. Other popular covers were recorded by Nina Simone and Peter Tosh.On November 20, 1976, Harrison performed this with Paul Simon on Saturday Night Live. On a previous show, producer Lorne Michaels offered The Beatles $3,000 (union minimum), to show up and perform. He said they could split it up any way they wanted, giving Ringo less if they felt like it. Lennon and McCartney were watching together in New York at the time and almost went. On the show when Harrison performed this, there is a skit where he is arguing with Michaels over the money. Michaels tries to explain that the $3000 was for the whole group, and he would have to accept less.When Harrison died in 2001, many artists performed this at their concerts as a tribute. It was played at the induction ceremonies of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of the all-star jam.See a garden display dedicated to George Harrison in Song Images.George Harrison played a guitar solo that was placed at 1:02 into the song, but didn't make the final cut. Here's the clip where George Martin and Dhani Harrison listen to it.Take That's Gary Barlow covered this for a 2012 advert for Marks and Spencer. It was the first song he'd recorded as a solo artist since his sophomore album, Twelve Months, Eleven Days in 1999. He said: \"It's a real a privilege to cover such an iconic track. You can't better perfection but I hope we've given it a modern twist that will capture the mood of the nation and provide the perfect anthem for summer 2012.\" The song's exposure on the commercial resulted in the original Beatles recording charting in the UK singles top 75 for the first time.Tom Petty, who was Harrison's good friend and played with him in the Traveling Wilburys, said of this song in Rolling Stone: \"No piece of music can make you feel better than this. It's such an optimistic song, with that little bit of ache in it that makes the happiness mean even more.\"","here_there_and_everywhere":"Paul McCartney wrote this song while he was lounging at John Lennon's pool. It was at least partly inspired by The Beach Boys' song \"God Only Knows.\" McCartney was asked in 1990 about the influence of The Beach Boys on this song by Brian Wilson biographer David Leaf. Said Paul: \"It's actually just the introduction that's influenced. John and I used to be interested in what the old fashioned writers used to call the verse, which we nowadays would call the intro - this whole preamble to a song, and I wanted to have one of those on the front of 'Here, There and Everywhere.' John and I were quite into those from the old-fashioned songs that used to have them, and in putting that [sings \"To lead a better life\"] on the front of 'Here, There and Everywhere,' we were doing harmonies, and the inspiration for that was the Beach Boys. We had that in our minds during the introduction to 'Here, There and Everywhere.'I don't think anyone, unless I told them, would even notice, but we'd often do that, get something off an artist or artists that you really liked and have them in your mind while you were recording things, to give you the inspiration and give you the direction - nearly always, it ended up sounding more like us than them anyway.\"John Lennon and Paul McCartney both mentioned this as one of the most underrated Beatles songs. In 2005 interviews, McCartney said that of all the songs he has written, this is his favorite. He likes it best because of the way that it flows together, comparing it to the style of the Fred Astaire hit \"Cheek To Cheek,\" one of his favorite songs. (thanks, Kristina - small town, NE)McCartney was trying to sing this like Marianne Faithfull, a popular singer in the '60s who was Mick Jagger's girlfriend.McCartney drew lyrical inspiration from the additional press coverage he was getting since he started going out with actress Jane Asher. At the time, McCartney may have been the most eligible bachelor on the planet, and it was a big deal when he began dating Asher, who acted in various stage productions and appeared in the movie Alfie. They broke up in 1968.McCartney played this in the opening sequence of his 1984 movie Give My Regards to Broad Street. After this scene, the movie goes pretty much downhill, following McCartney as he tries to recover missing master tapes.The self-taught guitar prodigy George Benson covered this on this on this 1989 album Tenderly. Benson's arrangement features orchestral strings and a solo piano intro. Emmylou Harris also covered the song in 1976.The Beatles never performed this song live, and McCartney didn't perform it until his 1991 acoustic appearance on MTV's Unplugged. He later played it on his 2002 Back In The US tour, where he added an accordion to the arrangement.This was influenced by both the Great American Songbook and Brazilian music. \"That song was coming off a lot of things,\" McCartney told Mojo magazine in 2012. \"At the time there was Brazilian music coming in - Joao Gilberto recorded 'Fool on the Hill' (McCartney may be thinking of Sergio Mendes \u0026 Brasil 66's pop bossa version). There was cross-fertilisation going on. You'd hear it and think how lovely those Brazilian chords were, so you'd work it into something else. At the same time I found myself really loving all these old songs and trying to write something that was comparable in skill and structure.\"","hey_bulldog":"The Beatles recorded this while they were filming the promotional video for \"Lady Madonna.\" Since they had to be in a studio while filming, Paul McCartney thought they should record a song.They started recording this as \"Hey Bullfrog,\" but Paul barked at the end and made John Lennon laugh. They kept in the barking and changed the title, even though there is no mention of a bulldog in the verses or chorus. \"Hey Bulldog\" is chanted four times before John and Paul's playful banter and then twice during the fade-out.This was the first recording session to which John Lennon brought Yoko.This was the last song The Beatles recorded before leaving for a retreat in India to study meditation with the Maharishi.John Lennon called this \"a good sounding record that means nothing.\" Musically, it has some interesting nuances. The middle part contains an interesting example of Lennon's polyphonic technique: The piano in the background does not follow the singer. Near the end of the song, Lennon talks while accompanied by the music, which could be considered a forerunner to Rap. In the climax, Lennon starts shouting, and the others follow. They scream like mad while the guitar in the background plays the same notes again and again, as if nothing has happened. (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)The original title was \"You Can Talk To Me.\"The Beatles wanted to use this in the movie Yellow Submarine, but it didn't make the cut. When the film was re-released in 1999, the scene with this was included. The soundtrack was made up of songs that had been unreleased or previously released as singles. Going with the theme of the movie, the album cover contained psychedelic cartoon likenesses of The Beatles. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)While John and Paul are yelling and barking towards the end, Paul can clearly be heard saying, \"Hey, don't look at me man, I only have ten children.\" (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)The official promo film for \"Lady Madonna\" (studio footage) is actually the recording session for this song. (thanks, Barry Kesten - Bellmore, Washington)This was covered by Toad The Wet Sprocket and used in the 1997 film I Know What You Did Last Summer. (thanks, Erik - Fairfield County, CT)The British psychedelic rock band The Gods covered this in 1969 and released it unsuccessfully as a single. The Gods featured two future Uriah Heep members: Ken Hensley (guitar/vocals) and Lee Kerslake (drums).This song was also covered by former National Hockey League player and coach Jim Schoenfeld on his 1973 album Schony, which he recorded while he played for the Buffalo Sabres. Schoenfeld was named Assistant General Manager of the New York Rangers in 2007. (thanks, Randy - Buffalo, NY)Dave Grohl and Jeff Lynne performed this song on the CBS tribute special The Beatles: The Night That Changed America, which aired on the 50th anniversary of the group's first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show. Grohl introduced the song by saying: \"This was not one of The Beatles greatest hits, but to me it's the quintessential Beatles rocker: Paul's rolling bassline, the trademark Ringo drum fills, George's gritty, distorted guitar, and that sound that only the back of John Lennon's throat could produce.\"","hey_jude":"Paul McCartney wrote this as \"Hey Jules,\" a song meant to comfort John Lennon's 5-year-old son Julian as his parents were getting a divorce. The change to \"Jude\" was inspired by the character \"Jud\" in the musical Oklahoma! (McCartney loves show tunes)In 1987 Julian ran into Paul in New York City when they were staying at the same hotel and he finally heard Paul tell him the story of the song firsthand. He admitted to Paul that growing up, he'd always felt closer to him than to his own father. In Steve Turner's book The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song, Julian said: \"Paul told me he'd been thinking about my circumstances, about what I was going through and what I'd have to go through. Paul and I used to hang out quite a bit - more than Dad and I did... There seem to be far more pictures of me and Paul playing at that age than me and Dad. I've never really wanted to know the truth of how Dad was and how he was with me. There was some very negative stuff - like when he said that I'd come out of a whisky bottle on a Saturday night. That's tough to deal with. You think, where's the love in that? It surprises me whenever I hear the song. It's strange to think someone has written a song about you. It still touches me.\"This was the Beatles longest single, running 7:11, and at the time was the longest song ever released as a single. It was the first long song to get a lot of airplay, as radio stations still preferred short ones so they could play more of them. When this became a hit, stations learned that listeners would stick around if they liked the song, which paved the way for long songs like \"American Pie\" and \"Layla.\" Disc jockeys were the real winners here, as they could finally take a reasonable bathroom break.The Beatles inner circle was shifting when Paul McCartney wrote this song. John Lennon had recently taken up with Yoko and cast off his first wife, Cynthia; McCartney had broken off his engagement with his longtime girlfriend Jane Asher. He was the only Beatle to reach out to Cynthia and Julian at this time.The drive to the Lennon home in Surrey was one of reflection for McCartney, who thought about Julian and how difficult life could be as a child of divorce. He wrote the line, \"Don't make it bad, take a sad song and make it better\" thinking about how he could encourage the boy.Paul was conditioned to think up songs on this trip, as he used to drive to the home for songwriting sessions with John - there were instruments and recording equipment in the attic.This was the first song released on Apple Records, the record label owned by The Beatles. It was recorded at Trident Studios, London, on July 31 and August 1, 1968 with a 36 piece orchestra. Orchestra members clapped and sang on the fadeout - they earned double their normal rate for their efforts.Paul McCartney on his songwriting partnership with John Lennon in Observer Music Monthly October 2007: \"I have fond flashbacks of John writing - he'd scribble it down real quick, desperate to get back to the guitar. But I knew at that moment that this was going to be a good collaboration. Like when I did 'Hey Jude.' I was going through it for him and Yoko when I was living in London. I had a music room at the top of the house and I was playing 'Hey Jude' when I got to the line 'The movement you need is on your shoulder' and I turned round to John and said: 'I'll fix that if you want.' And he said: 'You won't, you know, that's a great line, that's the best line in it.' Now that's the other side of a great collaborator - don't touch it, man, that's OK.\"This song hit #1 in at least 12 countries and by the end of 1968 had sold more than 5 million copies. It eventually sold over 10 million copies in the United States, becoming the fourth-biggest selling Beatles single there. Factoring in the price of records in 1968 vs. 1964, when the top-seller \"I Want To Hold Your Hand\" was released, \"Hey Jude\" might be the biggest earner.When McCartney played this song for John Lennon and Yoko Ono, John interpreted it as being about him; he heard the line \"You were made to go out and get her\" as Paul imploring him to leave his first wife and go after Yoko (\"I always heard it as a song to me,\" said Lennon). This was one of Lennon's more narcissistic moments, as he failed to grasp that the song was written for his son.This was going to be the B-side to \"Revolution,\" but it ended up the other way around. It is a testament to this song that it pushed \"Revolution\" to the other side of the record.George Harrison wanted to play a guitar riff after the vocal phrases, but Paul wouldn't let him. Things got tense between them around this time as McCartney got very particular about how Harrison played on songs he wrote.Julian Lennon didn't find out that this song was written for him until he was a teenager. It was around this time that he reconnected with his dad, who he would visit in New York from time to time until his death.The Beatles filmed a music video (called a \"promotional film\" at the time) for this song, which was directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg. He had the Beatles mime the song in front of an audience of about 100 people, who sang it with them. This was the closest the Beatles had come to a live performance since they had stopped touring two years earlier.The clip first aired on the UK program The David Frost Show in 1968, and was quickly picked up by other shows, giving the song a big promotional push.In terms of songcraft, this is one of the most studied Beatles songs. It starts with a vocal - Paul's voice singing \"Hey\" - then the piano comes in (an F chord). The song gradually builds, with McCartney alone playing on the first verse, then the sounds of George Harrison's guitar, Ringo's tambourine, and harmony vocals by George and John. The drums enter about 50 seconds in, and the song builds from there, reaching a peak of intensity with McCartney delivering the \"better... better... better\" line punctuated by a Little Richard-style scream, then the famous singalong resolution.The \"na na na\" fadeout takes four minutes. The chorus is repeated 19 times.\"Jude\" is the German word for \"Jew.\" The Beatles owned a retail store on Baker Street in London called the  Apple Boutique, which they closed around the time this song was released. On the shuttered building, an employee scrawled the words \"Revolution\" and \"Hey Jude\" to promote the new Beatles single. Without proper context, this proved offensive to Jewish residents, who read it as hateful graffiti.Wilson Pickett recorded this shortly after The Beatles did. His version hit #16 UK and #23 US and provided the name for his album. Duane Allman played on it and got a huge career boost when the song became a hit. He spent the next year as a session guitarist for many famous singers and then formed The Allman Brothers, who are considered the greatest Southern Rock band of all time.Thanks to the communal nature of this song, it is sometimes used to pay tribute to those who have passed. When Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr appeared on the 2014 CBS special The Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to the Beatles, Paul dedicated the song John Lennon and George Harrison. Musicians who performed earlier in the show joined on stage for the ending, which closed the telecast.In America, an album called Hey Jude (originally titled \"The Beatles Again\") was released in 1970 containing this and several other Beatles songs that were released as singles or B-sides. The album has not appeared as a CD because Apple Records made the decision to copy only the British LP releases onto CD. In the '60s the American record company managed to get extra LPs off the British releases by cutting down the number of tracks, then putting them out with singles and B-sides as additional albums. (thanks, Tommy - Glasgow, Scotland)As discussed in the DVD Composing the Beatles Songbook, while Paul wrote this song for Julian, in a lot of ways McCartney wrote this song about his brand-new relationship with Linda Eastman.After the \"Oh\" in the crescendo, McCartney sings \"YEAH!\" in a non-falsetto voice. The note he hits is F Natural above male High C, a very difficult note for a male to hit in a non-falsetto voice.The original 1968 version was recorded in mono, and many listeners find it far superior to the stereo remake from 1970, which is much more heavily produced.On The Beatles Anthology 3, there is a version of this song with an introduction spoken by John and Paul: \"From the heart of the black country: When I was a robber in Boston place You gathered round me with your fine embrace.\"\"Boston place\" (mentioned by Paul) is a small London street where The Beatles' company Apple had just installed an electronics laboratory. In a more familiar scene, Boston Street was that street in which The Beatles ran for the title sequence of their film A Hard Day's Night. John spoke of the \"Black Country,\" which was the name of the old smokestack industrial region in the middle of England.Richie Havens played this at Woodstock when he opened the festival in 1969.If you listen at about 2:55, you hear a sound from John Lennon while Paul keeps singing. It sounds like \"Ohh!\" at first, but it is really him saying \"...chord!\" You can barely hear it, but if you listen really closely, you can hear him say \"Got the wrong CHORD.\" He says \"chord\" much louder than the other words. And about two or three counts later, you can hear McCartney say \"F**king hell.\" (thanks, Sydney - McHenry, IL)The song debuted at #10 in the Hot 100, and in doing so it made history by becoming the first ever single to reach the top 10 in its first week on the chart. When the Beatles music was made available for download for the first time - on iTunes November 16, 2010 - \"Hey Jude\" was the most downloaded Beatles song that day.This was named as the song most often referred to in literature in a list compiled by culture interpretation website Small Demons. Amongst the 55 books the site says it's mentioned in are Stephen King's Wolves of the Calla (\"Why do people over here sing Hey Jude? I don't know\") and Toni Morrison's Paradise (\"Soane had been horrified – and he drove off accompanying Hey Jude on his radio\").Elvis Presley's \"Heartbreak Hotel\" was runner-up on the list and Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway To Heaven\" came in third placeMcCartney played this at the 2005 Live8 concert in London. He started with \"The Long and Winding Road\" and flowed it into the end of this, which ended the Live8 concert. (thanks, Ethan - Ridgely, MD)Paul McCartney played this at the 2005 Super Bowl halftime show. He performed the year after Janet Jackson's breast was exposed on stage, causing an uproar. McCartney was deemed a safe and reliable choice for a nudity-free performance.Sesame Street did a parody of this (and tribute to healthy eating) called \"Hey Food.\"","hold_me_tight":"One of the lesser-known Beatles songs, this was recorded during the Please Please Me sessions, but left off the album. The Beatles re-recorded it for With The Beatles.Paul McCartney: \"I can't remember much about that one. Certain songs were just 'work' songs, you haven't got much memory of them. That's one of them.\" (thanks, Niall - Dublin, Ireland, for above 2)","honey_pie":"This song was a pastiche of the classic 1940's swing and sentimental ballads written by Cole Porter, Irving Berlin or Sammy Cahn. Paul McCartney explained in Barry Miles' biography of the Beatle, Many Years From Now: \"Both John and I had a great love for music hall I very much liked that old crooner style - the strange fruity voice that they used, so 'Honey Pie' was me writing one of them to an imaginary woman, across the ocean, on the silver screen, who was called Honey Pie. It's another of my fantasy songs. We put a sound on my voice to make it sound like a scratchy old record. So it's not a parody, it's a nod to the vaudeville tradition that I was raised on.\"John Lennon played lead guitar, George Harrison bass. During the White Album sessions, The Beatles often recorded in separate studios recording different parts. One would be doing vocals for a song while the other would do horns or guitar in a different studio. George Martin's assistant Chris Thomas ended up doing much of the work because Martin couldn't be in two places at once. (thanks, Christine - Golden, CO)Scratches were added to an opening line from an old 78 RPM record to give a dated feel.Beatles producer George Martin scored the brass and woodwind arrangement.","i_am_the_walrus":"John Lennon wrote this song. As stated in the DVD Composing the Beatles Songbook, John was throwing together nonsense lyrics to mess with the heads of scholars trying to dissect The Beatles songs. They also mention that it's John's answer to Bob Dylan's \"getting away with murder\" style of songwriting. Lennon told Playboy years later that \"I can write that crap too,\" which is rarely mentioned in relation to this song.Lennon explained the origins of this song in his 1980 Playboy interview: \"The first line was written on one acid trip one weekend. The second line was written on the next acid trip the next weekend, and it was filled in after I met Yoko. Part of it was putting down Hare Krishna. All these people were going on about Hare Krishna, Allen Ginsberg in particular. The reference to 'Element'ry penguin' is the elementary, naive attitude of going around chanting, 'Hare Krishna,' or putting all your faith in any one idol. I was writing obscurely, a la Dylan, in those days.\"Lennon got the idea for the oblique lyrics when he received a letter from a student who explained that his English teacher was having the class analyze Beatles songs. Lennon answered the letter; his reply was sold as memorabilia at a 1992 auction. (thanks, Emery - San Jose, CA)The voices at the end of the song came from a BBC broadcast of the Shakespeare play King Lear, which John Lennon heard when he turned on the radio while they were working on the song. He decided to mix bits of the broadcast into the song, resulting in some radio static and disjointed bits of dialogue.The section of King Lear used came from Act Four, Scene 6, with Oswald saying: \"Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse,\" which comes in at the 3:52 mark. After Oswald dies, we hear this dialogue:Edgar: \"I know thee well: a serviceable villain, As duteous to the vices of thy mistress As badness would desire.\"Gloucester: \"What, is he dead?\"Edgar: \"Sit you down, father. Rest you.\"The idea for the Walrus came from the poem The Walrus and The Carpenter, which is from the sequel to Alice in Wonderland called Through the Looking-Glass. In his 1980 Playboy interview, Lennon said: \"It never dawned on me that Lewis Carroll was commenting on the capitalist and social system. I never went into that bit about what he really meant, like people are doing with the Beatles' work. Later, I went back and looked at it and realized that the walrus was the bad guy in the story and the carpenter was the good guy. I thought, Oh, s--t, I picked the wrong guy. I should have said, 'I am the carpenter.' But that wouldn't have been the same, would it?\"When Lennon decided to write confusing lyrics, he asked his friend Pete Shotton for a nursery rhyme they used to sing. Shotton gave them this rhyme, which Lennon incorporated into the song:\"Yellow matter custard, green slop pie, all mixed together with a dead dog's eye.Slap it on a butty, ten foot thick, then wash it all down with a cup of cold sick.\"The song's opening line, \"I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together\" is based on the song \"Marching To Pretoria,\" which contains the lyric, \"I'm with you and you're with me and we are all together.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 3)The choir at the end sings \"Oompah, oompah, stick it in your jumper\" and \"Everybody's got one, everybody's got one.\"This song helped fuel the rumor that Paul McCartney was dead. It's quite a stretch, but theorists found these clues in the lyrics, none of which are substantiated:\"Waiting for the van to come\" means the three remaining Beatles are waiting for a police van to come. \"Pretty little policemen in a row\" means policemen did show up.\"Goo goo ga joob\" were the final words that Humpty Dumpty said before he fell off the wall and died.During the fade, while the choir sings, a voice says \"Bury Me\" which is what Paul might have said after he died.During the fade, we hear someone reciting the death scene from Shakespeare's play \"King Lear.\"In addition, a rumor circulated that Walrus was Greek for \"corpse\" (it isn't) in Greek, so that is what people thought of Paul being the Walrus. Also, in the video, the walrus was the only dark costume.The BBC banned this for the lines \"pornographic priestess\" and \"let your knickers down.\"This was released as the B-side to \"Hello Goodbye,\" which Paul McCartney wrote. This angered Lennon because he felt this was much better.In The Beatles song \"Glass Onion,\" Lennon sang, \"The Walrus was Paul.\" He got a kick out of how people tried to interpret his lyrics and figure out who the Walrus was.Lennon got the line \"Goo Goo Ga Joob\" from the book Finnegan's Wake by James Joyce. \"Semolina Pilchard\" was Detective Sergeant Norman Pilcher, head of the Scotland Yard Drugs Unit. He led the arrests of both John Lennon and Brian Jones et al, before being investigated himself for blackmail and bribery in the '70s. (thanks, Matt - London, England)Eric Burdon (of Animals and War fame) stated in his biography that he is the Egg Man. It seems he told John Lennon of a sexual experience he was involved in where an egg played a major part. After that, John called him Egg Man.ELO's song \"Hello My Old Friend\" has an identical form to this - almost the same tune and orchestration but different words. No wonder Jeff Lynne is sometimes referred to as the sixth Beatle.In the Anthology version of this song, they experiment with four octaves in the intro. Also, just before Lennon says, \"Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun,\" Ringo does two hits on snare and floor tom before hitting crash. (thanks, Riley - Elmhurst, IL)In an episode of The Simpsons, \"The Bart Of War,\" airing May 18, 2003, Bart and Milhouse break into a secret room in the Flanders' household to discover that Ned is a Beatles fanatic. Bart takes a sip from a can of 40-year-old Beatles-themed novelty soda and quotes this song: \"Yellow matter custard dripping from a dead dog's eye,\" while Milhouse takes a trip and sees various Beatles inspired hallucinations. (thanks, Ashley - Moncton, Canada)Styx covered this song in 2004 and made a music video for it with a cameo from Billy Bob Thornton. They performed it at Eric Clapton's Crossroads benefit that year, and incorporated it into their set lists. Their version appears on their One with Everything DVD. (thanks, Caitlyn - Farmington Hills, MI)After John Lennon went solo, he wrote a song called \"God\" where he sang, \"I was the walrus, but now I am John.\" (thanks, Webspin - Daytona, FL)Artists to cover this song include Guided By Voices, Jackyl, Phil Lesh, Love/Hate, Men Without Hats, Oasis, Oingo Boingo, Spooky Tooth and Styx. The Dead Milkmen recorded a completely different song with the same title in 1987.Frank Zappa and the Mothers Of Invention performed the song as part of their late '70s - early '80s live repertoire, giving it their own comic treatment. It was a favorite of the fans. (thanks, Dan - Milwaukee, WI)See the Beatles \"Sitting in an English garden\" in Song Images.Bono sings this song in the movie Across the Universe, a film centered around the music of The Beatles. In the film, he plays Dr. Robert, also a reference to another Beatles song. (thanks, Jordan - Brooklyn, NY)This was the first song the Beatles recorded after Brian Epstein's death. Engineer Geoff Emerick recalled, \"the look of emptiness on their faces when they were playing.\"John Lennon's \"I'm Crying...\" lyric came from the Smokey Robinson \u0026 the Miracles song \"Ooh Baby Baby,\" where Robinson sings that phrase in the refrain.","i_call_your_name":"John Lennon wrote this for Billy J. Kramer, whose band Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas was signed to The Beatles British record label. Kramer released it as the B-side of his single \"Bad to Me\" in 1963. (thanks, Russ - Seattle, WA)The first part Lennon composed 1957. Not until in spring 1964 - Lennon's very productive year - he composed the middle part. Lennon could create enormous power in his compositions with seemingly limited means: The middle part has only one melody, but in three different ways. This creates a feeling of desperation.The three variations in the middle part end in the same note, but are emphasized in different ways: 1) \"take it...\" 2) \"who can...\" 3) \"ya take it...\" At the same time a counter melody in a guitar binds the three variations. The middle part is almost exactly the same as the middle part in Lennon's \"And Your Bird Can Sing.\" (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)The Beatles released this as a B side to the Long Tall Sally EP in England. \"Long Tall Sally\" was one of the songs Paul McCartney sang in Hamburg, and also the song that got him officially inducted into the group. (thanks, Johnny - Los Angeles, CA)The Mamas \u0026 The Papas covered this in 1966. Their version appeared on their album If You Can Believe Your Eyes And Ears.","i_dont_want_to_spoil_the_party":"The melancholy tone of this song was quite a contrast to most of their songs at this point. Written by John Lennon, it was influenced by Lesley Gore's \"It's My Party.\" Lennon later explained that it was a personal song dealing with his frustrations in dealing with fame. Subsequent Lennon songs \"Help!\" and \"I'm a Loser\" had a similar theme.In America, this song was left off Beatles For Sale because of its depressing tone. It was used in the States as the B-side of the single \"Eight Days a Week,\" and got just enough airplay to crack the Top 40. In 1965 it appeared on the US album Beatles VI.In the stereo version, you can hear Lennon and McCartney singing \"Woo\" just before the solo, which is buried in the mono mix. George Harrison's guitar is also louder in the stereo mix. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for all above)Country singer Rosanne Cash's cover became a #1 Country hit in June 1989, making it the most successful Lennon-McCartney cover on the American Country chart.","i_feel_fine":"The first note of this song was the first time feedback was used on a record. It was created when Paul McCartney pushed his bass up against an amplifier.John Lennon wrote the majority of this song, which borrows from the \"Watch Your Step\" by the American blues musician Bobby Parker.In 2008, Parker told the Forgotten Hits newsletter: \"I've been in litigation for close to 55 years about some of this material that was stolen from me. They had 'Watch Your Step' on John Lennon's Jukebox and then that went out all over the country on PBS Television and people heard about it. John Lennon said how he had 'borrowed' that guitar part for HIS record, and pretty soon everybody knew about 'Watch Your Step.' I go over to England now and that's all they wanna hear, they don't even care about the new stuff I'm doin'. I'm out there playin' with Buddy Guy and Robert Gray, and they just wanna hear 'Watch Your Step' from John Lennon's Jukebox!\"The refrain is typical of Lennon's songwriting, with the three long notes: \"I'm so glad.\" The sudden explosive refrain in harmonies is similar to Giovanni Gabrieli's grand concerto \"In ecclesiis,\" an early baroque-music-piece. (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)There is a very faint sound at the end of the song that was rumored to be barking dogs. It's actually just McCartney goofing around.The Beatles included this in their setlist when the toured the US in August, 1965. Prior to their famous Shea Stadium appearance on August 15, they taped a performance of this song and five others for an Ed Sullivan Show episode that aired September 12.The group made two music videos for this song as part of a one-day shoot where they banged out takes for four others as well. These were not high-concept films: just the band having some fun while lip-synching the tracks. The first \"I Feel Fine\" video got pretty goofy, with Ringo riding a stationary bike. For the second, the band simply sits down and eats lunch. This later version wasn't released until 2015 when it was included on the 1+ collection. ","i_me_mine":"George Harrison wrote this song and sang lead. He said it is \"About the ego, the eternal problem.\"This uses a 3/4 time signature like a waltz, rather than the standard 4/4. With a rather mournful sound, Harrison called it a \"heavy waltz.\"This song owes its release to the Beatles movie Let It Be. Filmed in 1969 and originally called \"Get Back,\" the plan was to get footage of the group recording the album and use it as a TV special or movie. During sessions at Twickenham Studios in London, Harrison, McCartney and Starr played an early version of this song as John Lennon and his future wife Yoko Ono waltzed to it. The movie was shelved, and Let It Be moved forward as an album, but without \"I Me Mine.\"Later in 1969, The Beatles manager, Allen Klein, made a deal with United Artists to release the film. With the project revived, a new version of \"I Me Mine\" was needed for the film and the soundtrack - the footage of John and Yoko dancing together was deemed crucial to the film. On January 3, 1970, the Beatles - minus Lennon - assembled at Abbey Road studios and recorded a polished version of the song with George Martin producing. After further delays, The Beatles broke up and Phil Spector was brought in to produce the album from the tapes.The Beatles recorded this without John Lennon. The session took place just four days after the band learned that Let It Be was picked up as a movie and this song was needed for the soundtrack. By this time, the group had the #1 album in America with Abbey Road, but were fractured and moving on to solo projects - they wanted to get their remaining obligations settled quickly. With Lennon unavailable, George Harrison played acoustic guitar, Ringo Starr handled drums and Paul McCartney played electric bass and overdubbed organ and electric piano. Harrison also played the electric guitar lead which he overdubbed. What was so unusual about this session was the efficiency. In their later years, The Beatles spent a lot of time working up songs in the studio, but this one was completed in just one day.The first version The Beatles recorded ran just 1:34, and had only one chorus. The album's producer, Phil Specter, copied and pasted parts of that recording to make the song 2:25.When the album was re-released in 2003 as Let It Be... Naked, the songs were remixed to eliminate most of Phil Spector's lush production. His edit to make this longer was one of the few things he did that was left alone.Harrison's 1980 autobiography is titled \"I Me Mine.\" The book was reissued in 2002.","i_need_you":"George Harrison wrote this for his girlfriend Pattie Boyd. They eventually got married.Pattie Boyd has inspired a lot of songs. Harrison also wrote \"Something\" about her, and Eric Clapton wrote \"Layla\" and \"Wonderful Tonight\" for her. She and Harrison officially divorced in 1977. She and Clapton were married from 1979-1988.The strange guitar sound is Harrison playing with a tone pedal.Since this was the only song of his in the movie Help!, Harrison made a point of saying \"I Need You by George Harrison,\" twice during the end credits. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)This is the second song written by Harrison that the band recorded. \"Don't Bother Me\" was the first. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","i_saw_her_standing_there":"John Lennon and Paul McCartney started writing this in McCartney's living room after they skipped school one day, with Paul writing the majority of this song in September of 1962.Paul McCartney in Observer Music Monthly October 2007 on the early days of his songwriting partnership with John Lennon: \"Those early days were really cool, just sussing each other out, and realizing that we were good. You just realize from what he was feeding back. Often it was your song or his song, it didn't always just start from nothing. Someone would always have a little germ of an idea. So I'd start off with [singing] 'She was just 17, she'd never been a beauty queen' and he'd be like, 'Oh no, that's useless' and 'You're right, that's bad, we've got to change that.' Then changing it into a really cool line: 'You know what I mean.' 'Yeah, that works.'\"The Beatles frequently played this at the Cavern Club, where they often played between 1961-1963. In fact, it was because of the crowd reaction to their live shows that George Martin decided to have them simply record their live show in the studio for their first album. That's why he kept Paul's \"1, 2, 3, 4\" count at the beginning, which was taken from the 9th take and edited on to the first. The title was originally \"Seventeen\" until it was changed for the album.The Beatles performed this on their first two Ed Sullivan Show appearances, which took place a week apart in February 1964. Getting on the show was a really big deal because it had a huge audience. About 73 million people watched the first show, which made The Beatles household names.This wasn't released as a single in England. In the US, it was released as the flip side of \"I Want To Hold Your Hand,\" which was their first hit in the America. The Beatles were famous in England about a year before they caught on in America.This became the first Beatles song performed on the TV series American Idol when Jordin Sparks won in 2007 and sang it on the finale with runner-up Blake Lewis. The first line of the song - \"She was just 17\" - was fitting, as that was Sparks' age.Chuck Berry was a big influence on The Beatles, and the bass line of this song borrows from Berry's track \"I'm Talking About You.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)This was the last song John Lennon performed for a paid audience. He played it at Madison Square Garden on November 28, 1974 when he took the stage at an Elton John concert. Elton released this version as the B-side of \"Philadelphia Freedom\" the following year. This was the only live duet ever recorded between Elton John and John Lennon, who were good friends.This was covered in 1987 by pop star (and future Playboy model) Tiffany. It was on her first album, and released as a single after her first hit, which was a cover of \"I Think We're Alone Now\" by Tommy James \u0026 the Shondells. The her was changed to him in Tiffany's version, which hit #7 US and #8 UK. (thanks, Nora - richfield, MN)At the 2001 World Series between the New York Yankees and Arizona Diamondbacks, McCartney went to one of the games at Yankee Stadium and was shown between innings singing along as this played in the stadium. It was McCartney's second visit to Yankee Stadium, and he saw The Yankees win that day, although they eventually lost the World Series.Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman sing this song during a very powerful scene in the 1988 Oscar-winning film Rain Man. (thanks, Ariel - Rehovot, Israel)The Who, Daniel Johnston, Santo \u0026 Johnny, and The Tubes all covered this song. (thanks, Airk - Skagway, AK)With Dave Grohl playing drums, Paul McCartney played this at the Grammy Awards in 2009.","i_should_have_known_better":"Composed by John Lennon, at first he \"hammers the melody on the same note.\" (The Italian composer Monteverdi discovered the effect of hammering on the same note. He called the style \"stile concitato\"). Then comes the middle part in long notes. The middle part has a change of keynote, which is unusual with such a change in a middle part. And then the rise in falsetto. Typical of Lennon's songs, there is also a rise of excitement. When you think that the mood will cool a little - when you come to the middle part - the excitement instead increases. (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)The Beatles performed this in their first movie, A Hard Day's Night. It was used in a scene where The Beatles sing it to a group of girls, one of which was played by an actress named Pattie Boyd. This was the first time George Harrison met her - he fell for her and married her a few years later. They divorced in 1977, and Pattie married Harrison's friend Eric Clapton in 1979. That marriage also ended in divorce, but along the way, Pattie inspired some of the most famous songs of all time, including The Beatles' \"Something\" and Clapton's \"Layla.\"This was done in three takes on Tuesday, February 25, 1964. But it didn't end there - they completely remade it the next day. The take you hear on record is Take 22. (thanks, Ben - Cheverly, MD)John Lennon's vocal was double-tracked to make it stand out.This was released as the B-side of \"A Hard Day's Night.\"Lennon played the harmonica solo.McCartney played a 12-string electric guitar on this track. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)At first, Lennon was proud of the composition, and said in 1964 that the song was one of the three best songs in the film A Hard Days Night. Later on he lost his self-confidence as a lyricist, and would often slag off his own songs as meaningless. He said in 1980 that \"I Should Have Known Better\" is, \"just a song, it doesn't mean a damn thing.\"","i_wanna_be_your_man":"John Lennon and Paul McCartney were working on this when they ran into the Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham on September 10, 1963 in London. Oldham did some work promoting The Beatles earlier in 1963, and invited John and Paul to the Studio 51 jazz club where The Stones were rehearsing. They had been working on \"I Wanna Be Your Man,\" and finished it at the rehearsal when they found out The Stones were looking for a song to use as their second UK single. They gave the song to The Stones but also recorded it themselves on their With The Beatles album. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were amazed at this display of songwriting prowess and soon began writing their own songs.Ringo sang lead, as the song was developed for him. It was his showpiece song during their live performances from 1963-1966.Contrary to popular opinion, this was not the only song recorded by both The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. \"Money (That's What I Want)\" was recorded by both groups as well. It appears on the album With the Beatles as well as the Stones' More Hot Rocks (Big Hits and Fazed Cookies). (thanks, Joel - Chicago, IL)Paul McCartney was the main author of this song, but it was finished up by both Lennon and McCartney during a jam session with The Rolling Stones. Lennon himself practically scoffed at the song, saying in an interview with David Sheff, \"It was a throwaway. The only two versions of the song were Ringo and the Rolling Stones. That shows how much importance we put on it: We weren't going to give them anything great, right?\"While the \"rivalry\" between The Beatles and The Rolling Stones was played up at the time for publicity purposes, Keith Richards eventually denied that any such rivalry was present.That's \"the fifth Beatle\" George Martin on the Hammond organ. Martin dismissed the honorary title as \"nonsense,\" but his contributions to the music world were nevertheless enough to get his UK status raised to that of \"knight bachelor\" in 1996.Meanwhile, producer Andrew Loog Oldham lives on without knighthood. It was Oldham, by the way, who first came up with the Stones' early \"anti-Beatles\" image, as a rougher, edgier counterpart to the \"adorable moptops\" Beatles image.The Beatles performed this song in their 1964 film A Hard Day's Night. The song was also used in a 2004 episode of the TV show Crossing Jordan in a version performed by Sam Phillips. She didn't change the gender and did a darker take on the song.","i_want_to_hold_your_hand":"This was the first Beatles song to catch on in America. In 1963, the Beatles became stars in England, but couldn't break through in the US. They couldn't get a major label to distribute their singles in America, so songs like \"Love Me Do\" and \"She Loves You\" were issued on small labels and flopped, even though they were hits in England. By February 1964, America finally took notice of The Beatles and bought this single in droves, giving them their first US hit. It sold better in first 10 days of release in the US than any other British single, and remains the best-selling Beatles single in the United States, moving over 12 million copies.The Beatles celebrated madly when they found out they were #1 in America. They came to America for the first time in February 1964, a week after this hit #1, and having the top single gave them a huge boost. Conquering the US was, and still is, a big deal for British bands. Many groups that are huge in the UK (Oasis, Blur) never really catch on in America.John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote this in Jane Asher's basement. Asher was an actress who became Paul's first high-profile girlfriend. After appearing in several movies, TV shows and stage productions, Asher became an authority on baking, and has her own business selling party cakes and supplying baking and decorating equipment. She and Paul broke up in 1968.Jane had a brother named Pete Asher who teamed up with Gordon Waller to form the duo Peter \u0026 Gordon and McCartney wrote for them their hit single \"A World Without Love.\" Pete recalled in a 2010 interview with Gibson.com the two Beatles penning this song at his home: \"My mother had a practice room that she used to give private oboe lessons when she wasn't teaching at The Royal Academy, where she was a professor. There was just a piano, and an upright chair and a sofa. Paul used that room to write in, from time to time. One afternoon John came over, while I was upstairs in my room. The two of them were in the basement for an hour or so, and Paul called me down to listen to a song they had just finished. I went downstairs and sat on the sofa, and they sat side by side, on the piano bench. That's where they played 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' for the first anywhere. They asked me what I thought. I said, 'I think it's very good.'\" [laughs]The Beatles performed this on their first 2 Ed Sullivan Show appearances, which took place Feb 9th and 16th, 1964. There was a media frenzy around The Beatles, as this was #1 on the charts and millions of people saw them on Sullivan's show. The Beatles were booked for the show before they had a hit in the US, so they actually got paid less than many other guests for their appearance.Bob Dylan thought the line \"I can't hide\" was \"I get high,\" and a reference to marijuana. He was surprised to learn they had never tried pot, and became part of Beatles lore when he introduced them to it.This was one of John Lennon's favorite Beatles songs. It starts with a falling melody, which is typical of Lennon's songwriting, and ends with a cadence with a quarter-interval: \"I'll think you'll understand.\" That quarter-interval cadence you can even hear in Lennon's first bit of \"From Me to You\" and in \"Tomorrow Never Knows.\" McCartney most often uses second-intervals. Also typically Lennon is the sudden octave-run, \"Haaaaand...\" The same octave-run you can hear in the end of the middle part in Lennon's \"Please Please Me\": \"To reason with youuuuuu...\" Also note that the beginning of the melody in the middle part is almost the same melody as the beginning of the middle part in \"Don't Let Me Down.\" (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)Two parody groups made answer songs to this in 1964: \"I'll Let You Hold My Hand\" by The Bootles and \"Yes, You Can Hold My Hand\" by The Beatlettes.This was played on a Washington, D.C. radio station before it was released in America by a DJ who got the record from a stewardess. It was a huge hit with his listeners.The first Beatles song recorded on 4 track equipment. Some of their first songs were in mono.The Beatles also cut a German version called \"Komm Gib Mir Deine Hand.\" The Beatles picked up some German while playing The Star Club in Hamburg in 1962.In the 1960s it wasn't uncommon for British stars to record new versions of their hits in other languages. The idea was to increase airplay on continental stations and to get a hit before an indigenous artist recorded a version in the local tongue. On January 29, 1964, The Beatles went into the Pathé Marconi Studios in Paris and recorded this song and \"She Loves You\" (\"Sie Liebt Dich\") in German. The lyrics had been hurriedly translated by a Luxembourger named Camillo Felgen, who was then a program director at Radio Luxembourg. As well, apart from their recording of \"My Bonnie\" in the early '60s, this was the only time The Beatles recorded in another language. In addition it was the sole occasion on which they recorded outside London.When this hit US #1 it was the first time a British group topped the charts in the US since 1962, when \"Telstar\" by The Tornados did it. The Beatles quickly began dominating the US charts.At times John Lennon realized that the crowds the Beatles played to were so loud that they really couldn't hear them sing, so sometimes instead of saying \"I want to hold your hand,\" John would say, \"I want to hold your gland\" as a reference to women's breasts. (thanks, bob - Laguna Beach, CA)It was the youth who discovered The Beatles, and while young people can be easily manipulated through hype and image, in the case of The Beatles it was the music that drew them in. An American girl Sanda Stewart, 15 years old in spring 1964 (according to Hunter Davies in his book Beatles) said: \"I was one day in a shop with my mother when I suddenly heard 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' on the car radio. Such a special sound! I could never stop thinking about it. No song has effected me on that way. Several other girls in school had reacted in the same way. We saw the Beatles on photos and thought they were ugly. But their music was fantastic.\" (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)This song was used in the movie Across the Universe at a much slower tempo. (thanks, Breanna - Henderson, NV)","i_want_to_tell_you":"George Harrison wrote this. He said it's \"About the avalanche of thoughts that are so hard to write down or say or transmit.\"This was the first Beatles song where the bass was overdubbed after recording.The working titles for this song were \"Laxton's Supreme\" and \"I Don't Know.\" (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)George Harrison later said that if he was to rewrite the bridge section he would have written: \"Although I seem to act unkind/It isn't me - it's just my mind. That is confusing things.\"","i_want_you_shes_so_heavy":"This was the last song mixed for Abbey Road, and it was the last time all four Beatles were in the studio together. It was the result of two unfinished songs woven together. Before they broke up, The Beatles had a lot of partially completed songs, many of which ended up in their solo work.John Lennon wrote this about Yoko Ono - the couple were married in March 1969, about six months before the Abbey Road album was released. Lennon was experimenting with a heavy blues sound, so the song has few lyrics and long stretches of repeated chords. \"Every time I pick up the guitar I sing about Yoko and that's how I'm influenced,\" Lennon said at the time. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Taken on its own, the lyric is very basic, repeating just a few simple lines like:I want you so badIt's driving me madSoon after Abbey Road was released, a news magazine show called 24 Hours read the lyrics out loud, taking a derisive tone. Lennon replied: \"To me that's a damn sight better lyric than 'Walrus' or 'Eleanor Rigby' because its progression to me. And if I want to write songs with no words or one word... maybe that's Yoko's influence.\"The rhythm was based on Mel Torme's song \"Coming Home Baby.\"With the exception of \"Revolution 9,\" this was The Beatles longest song.John Lennon sang this monofonic, as some of the troubadours sang in the Middle Ages: There is no chord behind the melody, but an instrument follows the singer's melody. The song ends with an orchestra arrangement, which was Lennon's idea, and is very much similar to the end of \"Entry of the Gods into Valhalla\" in \"Das Rheingold\" by Richard Wagner. (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)George Harrison played a Moog synthesizer on this track. It is one of the first uses of the instrument, which was custom-made for Harrison.The guitars were overdubbed many times to get a layered sound.This song contains an accidental background lyric. On stereo, play the song at 4:30 and listen very closely to the left speaker. In the bass break after John's scream, you can faintly hear someone say, \"What was that about!?\" presumably in response to the scream. (thanks, Tommy - Alameda, CA)","i_will":"In the televised documentary The Beatles Anthology, Paul, George and Ringo are shown relaxing on a blanket outside. Ringo asks Paul what he wrote in India and Paul answers, \"I Will.\" Then George begins playing the song on his ukulele while he and Paul harmonize with it.McCartney had the tune for a long time. While in India he made an unsuccessful attempt, together with psychedelic singer-songwriter Donovan, to pen a lyric to go with it, months before coming up with the elusive lyric on his own. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)Recorded at the end of The White Album sessions, the song has some unusual instrumentation. McCartney played acoustic guitar and vocalized the bass (you can hear him going \"bom, bom\" in parts). John Lennon and Ringo Starr both added percussion using various instruments; George Harrison didn't play on it at all.67 takes were recorded. The 65th was used.In 1995, this was recorded by the 18-year-old singer/songwriter/guitarist Ben Taylor, the son of Carly Simon and James Taylor. Ben Taylor's version was featured in the movie Bye Bye Love, starring Paul Reiser, and is also featured as part of the movie's soundtrack album. (thanks, Annabelle - Eugene, OR)Maureen McGovern covered this song for her 1992 album Baby I'm Yours.In the mind of Charles Manson, this song was a message from the Beatles that they were looking for him:For if at last I find youYour song will fill the air Manson took to mean that he should release an album. This along with many others were part of his deranged Helter Skelter plan. (thanks, Breanna - Henderson, NV)","ill_be_back":"John Lennon created this song around the chords of Del Shannon's \"Runaway.\" It was credited to Lennon/McCartney, but was written mostly by John. (thanks, Cara - Strawberry Fields, England)In the US, this was released on the album Beatles 65. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Lennon's original intent for this song was for it to be a waltz. The demo The Beatles recorded at the last session for A Hard Day's Night is performed in this style. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)","ill_cry_instead":"The Beatles recorded this in two sections that were then edited together.There is an extra verse on US album version.Joe Cocker covered this. He had a #1 hit with his version of The Beatles \"A Little Help From My Friends\" 4 years later.This was intended for the Beatles film A Hard Day's Night, but it was replaced by \"Can't Buy Me Love.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","ill_follow_the_sun":"Paul McCartney wrote this before he joined The Beatles.The Beatles held off releasing this because at the time, ballads did not fit their hard-rocking image.The song that follows this on Beatles For Sale is \"Mr. Moonlight,\" creating a sun/moon contrast. (thanks, Ian - Lethbridge, Canada)In 2008, a reel-to-reel tape containing outtakes of this song where Lennon and McCartney's attempts to finish recording cause them to break into laughter was auctioned off in England for about $23,000 in early August 2008. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","ill_get_you":"An early Beatles track, this was written as the follow-up to the Beatles hit \"From Me to You,\" but was bumped in favor of \"She Loves You,\" and appeared as the B-side of that track.John Lennon wrote most of this song, with some help from Paul McCartney on the bridge, who came up with a chord change inspired by Joan Baez' version of \"All My Trials.\"This is a rare Beatles song with twin-lead vocals by McCartney and Lennon where they are not harmonizing.The song was recorded in stereo, but that version has been lost. This remains one of 4 Beatles tracks that exist only in mono. The others: \"Love Me Do,\" \"She Loves You,\" and \"You Know My Name (Look Up The Number).\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France for all above)","im_a_loser":"John Lennon wrote this and also sang lead. He considered it one of his best early songsLennon: \"Me in my Dylan period... part of me suspects I'm a loser and part of me thinks I'm God almighty.\"John Lennon wrote this on a plane while The Beatles were touring with Jackie DeShannon. It was a songwriting departure from the lighter fare Lennon and McCartney previously wrote.John Lennon's lowest recorded note as a Beatle is a G, which he hits in this song. He also sings the G in the last \"going down\" of \"Happiness Is A Warm Gun.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2)","im_down":"Paul McCartney wrote this in the style of Little Richard. American R\u0026B singers like Richard were a big influence on The Beatles.The Beatles used this as their closing number on 1965 North American and UK tours, and 1966 World tour.The Beatles performed this on their third live Ed Sullivan Show appearance - September 12, 1965. Before The Beatles broke through in America, Sullivan was in the London airport when The Beatles returned from a tour of Sweden. When he saw the massive crowd there to greet them, he thought The Queen was arriving. When he found out the throngs were there for The Beatles, he made sure to book them on his show. He became a big fan and had them on whenever he could.This was the first song ever recorded by Aerosmith. They used it as a demo which eventually got them a record deal. They used it in 1987 on their album Permanent Vacation.This was used as the B-side of \"Help!\" McCartney was hoping it would be the A-side, as he and John Lennon (who wrote \"Help!\") had a rivalry over whose songs would be the A-sides. (thanks, Tommy - Flower Mound, TX)John Lennon played the Hammond organ. It was the first time Lennon played any kind of keyboard on a record. When The Beatles played this live, he often played an electric piano instead.This was recorded at the same session with \"Yesterday\" and \"I've Just Seen a Face.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2)The Beastie Boys recorded a version of this in 1986. Michael Jackson, who owns the publishing rights to this and many other Beatles songs, would not allow them to release it.Paul McCartney played this at the \"Concert For New York,\" a benefit show he helped organize in 2001 to help victims of the World Trade Center disaster. It was the first song of his set.","im_happy_just_to_dance_with_you":"John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote this as a showcase song for George Harrison, who sang lead. George had already written only one Beatles song by this point: \"Don't Bother Me.\" (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)Typical of the early Beatles, this is a very innocent song - the singer is taking it slow, as he's OK just dancing with the girl of his dreams. There is an old-time Irving Berlin/Cole Porter feel to the song, focusing on the de-lightful feeling of being smitten.The Beatles performed this in their movie A Hard Day's Night, giving Harrison some quality screen time.John Lennon wrote most of this song. Typical of his style, the first short notes are followed with tree longer notes. The Irvin Berlin influence comes when the melody rises in the five notes in \"kiss or hold your hand...\" In the cadence, Lennon jokes: he repeats the mentioned five notes, but just sinks it with a third. (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)The Beatles recorded this on Sunday, March 1, 1964 in 4 takes. Recording on a Sunday was very rare at the time. (thanks, Ben - Cheverly, MD)","im_looking_through_you":"Paul McCartney wrote this when his girlfriend, an actress named Jane Asher, left on a theater tour instead of staying home like he had hoped she would.Another Rubber Soul track, \"You Won't See Me,\" is also about Asher. Despite McCartney's musical barbs, she has steadfastly refused to speak about Paul.On the US stereo version, there are two false guitar intros. This version was released on Capitol Records.Ringo played the Hammond organ on this track.The version on the album is a second version the Beatles recorded. The one that appears on Anthology 2 was originally going to be the one put on Rubber Soul until a decision was made to do a remake. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)Back in the Beatles' early days, working at Abbey Road was expensive so rather than recording the song again, any small mistakes were frequently ignored. This explains why at around 1:20 on this track, if you listen carefully you can hear Paul McCartney dropping his tambourine.The Muppets performed this on an early episode of The Muppet Show. The Halloween skit featured slightly transparent Muppet ghosts.","im_only_sleeping":"John Lennon wrote this as a tribute to staying in bed, which he liked to do even when he wasn't sleeping.The song is discussed in the DVD Composing the Beatles Songbook where they mention a theory that it's John's attack on \"straight society,\" but conclude that the song IS about sleeping. John loved laying around in bed, sleeping, reading, watching telly or lovemaking. Didn't matter. He loved being in bed.Maureen Cleave wrote of John Lennon: \"He can sleep almost indefinitely, is probably the laziest person in England.\" She clarifies that she means physically lazy, not intellectually lazy.The yawning effect is a guitar recorded backward. A few seconds before the yawn comes in, you can hear John Lennon say, \"Yawn Paul.\"Perhaps the greatest legacy to this song was the famous \"bed-in\" protests staged by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. They invented the term as a derivative of \"sit-in\" protests. Their first was in March of 1969, subsequent to their marriage, in which they invited the press into their motel room while they advocated for world peace. Others soon copied the motif. It does bring to mind the old quote (variously attributed) \"All man's miseries derive from not being able to sit in a quiet room alone.\" Hey, if you stay in bed, you're not out fighting wars and making the world an uncool place, and if you've got someone with you, you're promoting more love in the world, right?Musically, \"I'm Only Sleeping\" is known for its backwards guitar. It was conceived by George Harrison in a late-night session, inspired when a studio engineer accidentally flipped a tape and Harrison was amazed at the effect and decided to \"do it for real.\" So he wrote down a solo and then played it twice, once forwards and once backwards, with fuzz effects on one track.This song also marks the embracing of pure psychedelic music by The Beatles, as do the majority of tracks on the Revolver album. The lyric about \"keeping an eye on the world going by my window\" also gets called back later in Lennon's later solo hit \"Watching The Wheels,\" which is also about passively being entertained by the busy goings-on of the world.","im_so_tired":"John Lennon wrote this at a transcendental meditation camp in India when he couldn't sleep. He was meditating day and night, and after three weeks of meditation and lectures by Indian gurus he missed his soon-to-be wife, Yoko Ono, and came up with the song. The Beatles went on the retreat to study with the Maharishi. When it was over, Lennon thought it was a crock, but he wrote some good songs while he was there. (thanks, Vicky - LA, CA)The voice at the end sounds like, \"Paul is dead man, miss him,\" when played backward. This helped fuel rumors that McCartney was dead and replaced by an actor that looked like him.The line \"When I hold you in my arms, and feel my finger on your trigger\" from \"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\" appears in bootlegged, unreleased versions of this song as \"When I hold you in your arms, when you show each one of your charms, I wonder should I get up and go to the funny farm.\" (thanks, Conrad - Los Angeles, CA)The word \"get\" as used in this song is a well-known term as a quite mild insult that is still commonly used on Merseyside. Lennon is cursing Sir Walter Raleigh (who is credited with introducing tobacco to Britain from America in the 16th century) for indirectly getting him hooked on cigarettes.","ive_got_a_feeling":"This is a mix of two unfinished songs, Paul McCartney's \"I've Got a Feeling\" and John Lennon's \"Everybody Had a Hard Year.\" In later years, The Beatles would sometimes cobble together songs from bits they hadn't completed. \"A Day In The Life\" is a good example.This was the last song Lennon and McCartney wrote as a partnership.The Beatles recorded this live on the Apple rooftop, which was used in their movie, Let It Be. They played on the roof as a way to end the movie, which was footage of The Beatles working out songs in the studio.Pearl Jam recorded this very early in their career; it was part of a 3 song promotional sampler sent out in May, 1991 when the band was just starting out. Let It Be was the first album Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam ever bought, and it was his idea to record the song. Eddie Vedder took some lyrical liberties, mentioning their Temple of the Dog project (\"Making Temple was a good time\"), their appearance in the movie Singles (\"Everybody had one line\") and the death of Seattle musician Andrew Wood (\"Everybody misses Andy\"). The sampler of this song went to the mailing lists of Soundgarden and Mother Love Bone, which was the band Ament, Wood and Stone Gossard were part of.","ive_just_seen_a_face":"Primarily written by Paul McCartney, the working title of this song was \"Auntie Gin's Theme\" because Paul McCartney's Aunt Gin liked it.This is one of the few times when Paul McCartney wrote a straight-up Country song, albeit at a much faster tempo. It has a sound similar to bluegrass. The Beatles would return to a sound similar to this with a few numbers from the White Album. Fans have even theorized, as \"Back In The U.S.S.R.\" was a shout-out to The Beach Boys and \"If I Needed Someone\" was a shout-out to The Byrds, that this song would have made a nice shout-out to Simon \u0026 Garfunkel.David Lee Roth performed this song on his 1988 Skyscraper tour.Ringo gets to play the maracas on this number. Maracas are those gourd-shaped percussion instruments with a handle, native to Latin America.One of five Beatles songs McCartney performed on his \"Wings Over America\" tour in 1976. It was one of the few songs from the Beatles' catalog to be performed by McCartney's subsequent band Wings in stage shows.In the US, \"I've Just Seen a Face\" was held back to be released on the Rubber Soul album, since the label wanted to give that album more acoustic numbers in keeping with the folk-rock fad popular at the time. In the UK, it was released on Help!!.It's not often that a bass player writes a song with no bass guitar, but that was the case here. This is one of the few Beatles songs without a bass guitar.","if_i_fell":"John Lennon wrote this song, which may have been influenced by the ambivalence he felt during his first marriage. Lennon called this song \"my first attempt at a ballad... it's semi autobiographical, but not consciously.\"Lennon and McCartney sang together into the same microphone when recording this song. John sang the lead on the intro, then Paul sang in a higher lead while John sang harmony. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)The structure of the song is rather intriguing. It opens with an intro that contains no musical elements found in the rest of the song, and the body of this song has no real verse/chorus structure, just 2 verses that each turn halfway through on an unexpected chord.The song is very expressive, with large intervals between the notes in a quasi-modal way. Typical of Lennon are the emphasis on three recurrent long notes (\"...give my heart...\"). It has similarities with John Dunstable's motet \"Quam pulchra es\" from the fifteenth century. The introduction is also unusual, with four modulations - even tighter than most music from late romantic music. (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)At the end of the second time that they sing, \"Would be sad if our new love was in vain,\" McCartney's voice cracks on \"vain,\" but on newer releases of the song this mistake is covered over. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)There were a few demos of this song recorded in January 1964 before The Beatles came to America. The proper recording came on Thursday, February 27, 1964. The take you hear on the album is Take 15. (thanks, Ben - Cheverly, MD)The Beatles performed this in the movie A Hard Day's Night. It was used in a scene where they perform to a group of school kids in a theater. The kids were all borrowed from nearby schools, and had no idea they would see The Beatles. On of the kids was 13-year-old Phil Collins, who didn't make the final cut, but was given outtakes with him in it years later when he contributed commentary for the DVD release of the movie.This was used as the B-side of \"And I Love Her.\"During their 1964 tour, Lennon had some fun with McCartney, adding the word \"over\" when Paul introduced the song. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","if_i_needed_someone":"This was written by George Harrison, who got the idea from a few of The Byrds' songs including \"The Bells of Rhymney\" and \"She Don't Care About Time.\" It was not Ravi Shankar that introduced George to the wonderment of sitar, but Byrd traveler David Crosby shortly after Shawn Phillips had shown him the basic steps. In 1965 The Beatles toured the US and visited Ravi at World Pacific Studios where The Byrds had permanent residency. It was also here that McGuinn's Rickenbacker jingle jangle influenced Harrison's \"If I Needed Someone.\" In turn, The Byrds were influenced by Harrison's 12-string guitar work. (thanks to Shiloh Noone, author of Seekers Guide To The Rhythm Of Yesteryear)Former Byrds guitarist Roger McGuinn recalled to Christianity Today magazine: \"George Harrison wrote that song after hearing the Byrds' recording of \"Bells of Rhymney.\" He gave a copy of his new recording to Derek Taylor, the Beatles' former press officer, who flew to Los Angeles and brought it to my house. He said George wanted me to know that he had written the song based on the rising and falling notes of my electric Rickenbacker 12-string guitar introduction. It was a great honor to have in some small way influenced our heroes the Beatles.\"","if_youve_got_trouble":"Although this was recorded in early 1965, The Beatles weren't content with it and decided not to release it. It was then released in 1996 on Anthology.This song was originally intended for the Help! album as Ringo's vocal track, The Beatles went with \"Act Naturally\" instead. (thanks, John - New York, NY, for above 2)","in_my_life":"This is an autobiographical song about John Lennon's life. He wrote most of the lyrics after being asked why a book he wrote, In His Own Write, revealed more about him than his songs did.The lyrics about friends refer to Stu Sutcliffe, an early Beatle and great friend of John's who died in 1962, and another friend named Pete Shotton. Lennon also thought of his Aunt Mimi and wife Cynthia, as well as other friends. One of the most beautiful Beatles songs, John called it \"A little piece of art work.\"The Beatles left a hole for the instrumental break when they recorded this. Producer George Martin filled it in the next morning by playing a piano solo and speeding up the tape to make it sound like a harpsichord. Lennon had asked him to fill it with something \"baroque.\"This was one of George Harrison's favorites. The other Beatles were not pleased when he played it with different lyrics at one of his concerts in 1974.Both Lennon and McCartney thought this was one of the best Beatles songs.There is controversy over how involved McCartney was in writing this song. Lennon claimed in later interviews that he wrote the whole thing, while McCartney claimed it was an equal collaboration.This was voted the best song of all time by a panel of songwriters in a 2000 Mojo magazine poll. The panelists included McCartney, Brian Wilson, Lamont Dozier, and Carole King.Dave Matthews played this at the 2001 special Come Together: A Night For John Lennon's Words And Music. The song took on new meaning, as the show aired three weeks after the terrorist attacks on America.Judy Collins, Ozzy Osbourne and Johnny Cash have all covered this. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)According to John Lennon: The Life and Legend (The Sunday Times: A Special Tribute 1980), Lennon began writing this in 1964. He forgot about the song for a while and he wrote it again one year later, with lyrics talking about people from his childhood and younger years. In John's original handwritten lyrics he made reference to several places in Liverpool:Penny Lane is one I'm missingUp Church Rd to the clocktowerIn the circle of the abbeyI have seen some happy hoursPast the tramsheds with no tramsOn the 5 bus into townPast the Dutch and St. ColumbusTo the Dockers Umbrella that they pilled downThe Dockers Umbrella was the world's first overhead railway (opened 1893). St. Columbus could refer to a school the bus passes. (thanks, Ian - Norwich, England)The music was inspired by The Temptations song \"You've Really Got A Hold On Me.\"This song was played at Kurt Cobain's funeral. The Beatles were an early and important music influence on him. Cobain even cited Lennon as his \"idol\" in the various journals he kept throughout his career with Nirvana. (thanks, Ashlynd - Charleston, WV)In an interview in the January 1971 edition of Rolling Stone, John Lennon recalled the writing of this song: \"I wrote that in Kenwood (his home at the time). I used to write upstairs where I had about ten Brunell tape recorders all linked up, I still have them, I'd mastered them over the period of a year or two - I could never make a rock and roll record but I could make some far out stuff on it. I wrote it upstairs, that was one where I wrote the lyrics first and then sang it.\" He added that was usually the case with songs such as this one and \"Across the Universe\" and \"some of the ones that stand out a bit.\"In a sign that Sarah McLachlan's \"I Will Remember You\" is not somehow mandated as the background music for any death montage, James Taylor performed \"In My Life\" at the 2010 Oscars when they showed who died in the past year. Rests in the music were filled with dialogue from film clips. (thanks, Breanna - Henderson, NV)Frequent Beatles photographer Robert Freeman took the album's cover shot of the unsmiling band in front of a garden hedge at Lennon's estate in Weybridge (Surrey, England). The off-kilter effect came by accident when one of the slides slipped and fell backward, but the guys, particularly McCartney, loved it. The distinctive bubble font on the cover of Rubber Soul was created by graphic designer Charles Front. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2)","in_spite_of_all_the_danger":"\"In Spite Of All The Danger\" is the first Beatles song ever recorded; it is also the only Beatles song credited to McCartney-Harrison, and the only Beatles song ever recorded in Liverpool!An original copy was produced by Colin Hanton in the May 2013 BBC documentary 'Rock 'N' Roll Britannia'. Hanton was drummer for The Quarrymen in 1957, and was still performing with them at the time this documentary was made.The record was cut at the home studio of Percy Phillips in Liverpool. \"In Spite Of All The Danger\" was the B-side; the A-side was the band's recording of \"That'll Be The Day.\" The credits were written on by hand - by McCartney. Although there is a little confusion about the date, it is generally believed to have been recorded on Saturday, June 12, 1958.At the time of recording, McCartney was 16 and Harrison was 15. The song was re-released professionally in July 1995 on the Anthology set. (thanks, Alexander Baron - London, England, for above 3)","it_wont_be_long":"In a 1980 interview with Playboy, John Lennon said that after some London critic remarked that \"It Won't Be Long\" contained \"Aeolian cadences,\" their popularity increased because they attracted the brainy set. Lennon confesses that to this day, he has no idea what an \"Aeolian cadence\" is. The Aeolian is also known as the natural minor scale, beginning on A.This song has been covered by House of Heroes on a Beatles' cover album, and also by Franz Ferdinand, The Quick, Richard Thompson, and the Beatles tribute supergroup Yellow Matter Custard - who are named after a line from \"I Am The Walrus.\"This song repeats the distinctive \"yeah, yeah\" chorus first popularized in \"She Loves You.\" In \"It Won't Be Long,\" the \"yeah\" shows up 56 times.The wordplay here between \"belong\" and \"be long\" was explained by Paul McCartney: \"I was doing literature at school, so I was interested in plays on words and onomatopoeia. John didn't do literature but he was quite well read, so he was interested in that kind of thing. Like the double meaning of 'please' in a line like 'Please, lend a little ear to my pleas' that we used in Please Please Me. We'd spot the double meaning. I think everyone did, by the way, it was not just the genius of us! In 'It won't be long till I belong to you' it was that same trip. We both liked to try and get a bit of double meaning in, so that was the high spot of writing that particular song. John mainly sang it so I expect that it was his original idea but we both sat down and wrote it together.\"Another Beatles song to use \"be long\" repeatedly is \"Blue Jay Way.\"This was the first song Neil Young performed for an audience. He played it at his high school cafeteria.John Lennon's vocal was double-tracked to make it stand out.","its_all_too_much":"George Harrison wrote this. It was inspired by his wife, Pattie.A verse was edited out of album version, cutting time from 8 minutes to 6. The full version appears in film Yellow Submarine.This was by far the longest Beatles song until \"Hey Jude\" was recorded over a year later. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)Paul McCartney played lead guitar on this song and John Lennon supplied the guitar feedback, allowing George to be free to concentrate only on vocals during the recording of this song. (thanks, Jonathon - Clermont, FL)","its_only_love":"John Lennon once said this was the only song he wrote that he truly hated. Lennon told British journalist Ray Connolly: \"It's the most embarrassing song I ever wrote. Everything rhymed. Disgusting lyrics. Even then I was so ashamed of the lyrics, I could hardly sing them. That was one song I really wished I'd never written.\"An instrumental version was recorded by George Martin and his orchestra. Martin was The Beatles producer.The original title was \"That's a Nice Hat (Cap).\"George Harrison used a tone pedal on this track to produce an unusual guitar sound.","julia":"John Lennon dedicated this song to Yoko and his mother Julia, who was struck and killed by a car driven by an off-duty police officer on July 15, 1958, when John was 17. Lennon was raised mostly by Julia's sister Mimi, but starting to see more of his mother at the time of her death.One of five daughters, nicknamed Judy by the family, Julia met Alf Lennon at the age of 14 while she was working as a cinema usher. Ten years later they married. Julia gave birth to John after 30 hours of labor, and Alf went AWOL when he jumped ship - neither the Navy nor Julia knew of his whereabouts. He later returned but Julia refused to reconcile. She was involved in a couple other relationships; John went to live with his aunt Mimi because Julia could not provide a sound home for the boy.When John was in is early teens he visited Julia often, and she taught him to play the banjo. John would frequently stay over at Julia's house, and in 1958 Julia was hit and killed by the off duty police officer as she walked home from Mimi's house. John named his first son Julian after her.Lennon recorded this by himself. He did it completely live with an acoustic guitar and occasional overdubs on the vocals. It is the only song he did completely on his own during his time with The Beatles. (thanks, Phillip - Louisville, KY)Psychedelic singer Donovan Leitch taught Lennon the finger-picking guitar style. Donovan was with The Beatles in India at the Maharishi's camp in Rishikesh, India in February 1968. When Lennon was in Rishikesh, one of the biggest revelations he had was truly opening up (to himself) regarding the feelings he had for his mother, Julia. In leaning the finger-picking method, it did allow John to dig deeper into his emotions. To quote Donovan: \"Learning a new style meant composing in a different way. In his deep meditation sessions, John had opened up feelings for his mother. He found release for these emotions in 'Julia,' the tune he had learned with the new finger style. I remember when I played 'Julia' on my guitar I was struck by how much the images in the song were like the images in my songs. They were very unLennon-like.\"The first 18 notes of this song are the same (in different metres, only changing the chords) but it's unlikely that this was done deliberately. If anything was deliberate about those notes, it would be that the number 18 resolves to a 9, which Lennon did slip into some of his tunes, but in this case, it was probably just a happy accident.In Japanese, the name Yoko means \"ocean child,\" which Lennon included as a line in the song.Sean Lennon sang this at the special Come Together: A Night For John Lennon's Words And Music, which was held October 2, 2001 at Madison Square Garden.Paul Shaffer and the Late Show Orchestra would play this every time Julia Roberts was a guest on The Late Show with David Letterman.\" (thanks, Phillip - Louisville, KY)In The Anime series Cowboy Bebop, the main character's \"girlfriend\" is named Julia. The creator named her after this song - most of the episodes are named after songs. (thanks, Nahtan - Dillsburg, PA)","lady_madonna":"Paul McCartney said that this song is a tribute to women everywhere. It was inspired by a picture of an African woman suckling her kid, over the caption \"Mountain Madonna.\"The piano arrangement was lifted from a '50s jazz classic: \"Bad Penny Blues\" by Humphrey Lyttleton.British jazz musicians were brought in on short notice to play the saxophone parts.John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison faked a brass solo by singing through their cupped hands.The Beatles recorded \"Lady Madonna\" at the same time they were recording its promotional film. In the video for this song, The Beatles are actually singing \"Hey Bulldog\" (for the most part). They went in to shoot \"Lady Madonna\" and John changed it at the last minute to \"Hey Bulldog.\" If you watch the video montage for \"Madonna\" closely, there's even footage from the Get Back sessions thrown in.This was one of five Beatles songs McCartney performed on his Wings Over America tour in 1976.Paul McCartney designed the ads for the single.This was the last Beatles release on Capitol Records (US), or Parlophone (UK). All future releases were on Apple Records, the label The Beatles created.A version sung by Aretha Franklin was used as the theme song for the TV series Grace Under Fire. The show starred comedian Brett Butler and ran on ABC from 1993-1998. For the last season, they used a different theme song.Fats Domino released a version of this later in 1968.Every day of the week is mentioned in the lyrics except Saturday. (thanks, Mike - Mountlake Terrace, WA)McCartney stated in the book The Love You Make that while singing \"Lady Madonna\" he used what he characterized as his \"Elvis voice.\" (thanks, Mike - Cambridge, MA)This was the only Hot 100 hit with \"Madonna\" in the title until 2015, when Madonna's \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" made the tally. In 2006, Robbie Williams charted in the UK with \"She's Madonna.\"","let_it_be":"Paul McCartney wrote this song. It was inspired by his mother, Mary, who died when he was 14. Many people thought \"Mother Mary\" was a biblical reference when they heard it.Since Let It Be was The Beatles last album, it made an appropriate statement about leaving problems behind and moving on in life. The album was supposed to convey an entirely different message. It was going to be called \"Get Back,\" and they were going to record it in front of an audience on live TV, with another TV special showing them practicing the songs in the studio. It was going to be The Beatles getting back to their roots and playing unadorned live music instead of struggling in the studio like they did for The White Album. When they started putting the album together, it became clear the project wouldn't work and George Harrison left the sessions. When he returned, they abandoned the live idea and decided to use the TV footage as their last movie. While the movie was being edited, The Beatles recorded and released Abbey Road, then broke up. Eventually, Phil Spector was given the tapes and asked to produce the album, which was released months after The Beatles broke up. By then, it was clear \"Let It Be\" would be a better name than \"Get Back.\"McCartney had a dream one night when he was paranoid and anxious. He saw his mom who had been dead for ten years or so; she came to him in his time of trouble, speaking words of wisdom. This brought him much peace when he needed it. It was this sweet dream that got him to begin writing the song.John Lennon hated this song because of it's apparent Christian overtones. He made the comment before recording it, \"And now we'd like to do Hark The Angels Come.\" Lennon saw to it that \"Maggie Mae,\" a song about a Liverpool prostitute, followed it on the album. (thanks, Mike - Mountlake Terrace, WA. for above 2)It was John Lennon who wanted Phil Spector to produce the album. Spector worked on Lennon's \"Instant Karma\" and was known for his bombastic \"Wall Of Sound\" style. McCartney hated Spector's production, and in 2003 he pushed to have the album remixed and released without Spector's influence. The result was Let It Be... Naked, which eliminated most of Spector's work and is much closer to what The Beatles intended for the album. \"Maggie Mae\" and \"Dig It\" were removed, and an entirely different guitar solo was used for this song.You'll hear different guitar parts on different versions on this song, as there were several overdubs of the solo. On April 30, 1969, George Harrison overdubbed a new guitar solo over the best take from the January 31, 1969 session. Harrison overdubbed another one on January 4, 1970, but there's a possibility that it was actually McCartney on that overdub. The first overdub solo was used for the original single release, and the second overdub solo was used for the original album release. The Let It Be... Naked version is the one from the movie.The Beatles weren't the first to release this song - Aretha Franklin was. The Queen of Soul recorded it in December 1969, and it was released on her album This Girl's In Love With You in January 1970, two months before The Beatles released their version (she also covered The Beatles \"Eleanor Rigby\" on that album).Aretha recorded it with the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, who were a group of musicians that owned their own studio in Alabama, but would travel to New York to record with Aretha. David Hood, who was their bass player, told us that Paul McCartney sent demos of the song to Atlantic Records (Franklin's label) and to the Muscle Shoals musicians. Said Hood, \"I kick myself for not grabbing that demo. Because I think they probably dropped it in the garbage. Our version was different. We changed it a little bit from his demo, where their version is different from that demo and from Aretha's version, as well. Just slightly, but little things.\"In April 1987, this was released as a charity single in aid of the The Sun newspaper's Zeebrugge ferry disaster fund. Featuring Paul McCartney, Mark Knopfler, Kate Bush, Boy George and many others, it was called \"Ferry Aid\" and spent 3 weeks at #1 in the UK. (thanks, Vishal - Delhi, India)Sesame Street used this with the title changed to \"Letter B.\" The lyrics were changed to list words that begin with B.This was the first Beatles song released in The Soviet Union. The single made it there in 1972.In 2001, McCartney helped organize the \"Concert For New York,\" to benefit victims of The World Trade Center disaster. He closed the show with this, inviting the other acts and some New York cops and firefighters on stage to sing with him.The album had the largest initial sales in US record history up to that time: 3.7 million advance orders. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)This song was played at Linda McCartney's funeral.On July 18, 2008, Paul McCartney joined Billy Joel onstage at Shea Stadium in New York and played this as the final song of the final concert at Shea. As a member of The Beatles, McCartney played the first stadium rock concert when they performed at Shea on August 15, 1965.According to Ian Macdonald's book Revolution in the Head, McCartney wrote \"Let It Be\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\" on the same day. (thanks, mick - london, United Kingdom)Until 1994 and the recordings for \"Free As A Bird,\" the session for this song on January 4, 1970 was the last Beatles recording session. Lennon wasn't present that day, as he was on holiday.A cover by American R\u0026B artist Jennifer Hudson featuring the Roots, who are the house band on NBC's Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, debuted at #98 on the Hot 100 in February 2010. She recorded it for the Hope For Haiti Now charity telecast after the earthquake that devastated the country. It was the third time the song had entered the US singles chart as Joan Baez's version peaked at #49 in 1971.A month after Jennifer Hudson's version reached the Hot 100, Kris Allen took the song to the chart for a fourth time when his cover debuted at #63. Allen's cut charted after he performed the song on American Idol, with proceeds from its digital sales benefiting Haiti earthquake relief efforts through the Idol Gives Back Foundation.John Legend and Alicia keys performed this song on the tribute special The Beatles: The Night That Changed America, which aired in 2014 exactly 50 years after the group made their famous appearance on Ed Sullivan Show. Legend introduced it as \"a song that has comforted generations with its beauty and its message.\"","like_dreamers_do":"This song was written by Paul McCartney in 1957. The Beatles performed it for an audition at Decca Records on January 1, 1962. (thanks, Ryan - London, England)","little_child":"Originally, Ringo was going to sing lead on this song, but John Lennon and Paul McCartney ended up sharing lead vocals.With The Beatles was The Beatles second album, and it charted at #1 in the UK. It became the second album (after the soundtrack from South Pacific) to sell a million copies in the UK. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2)","long_tall_sally":"This was originally recorded by Little Richard, who was one of The Beatles' inspirations. The Beatles met Little Richard at the Star Club in Hamburg when they were performing there in 1962. They also met Billy Preston there, who was Little Richard's keyboard player. They didn't see him again until 1969 when George Harrison saw him at a concert and brought him in to play piano for The Beatles on \"Don't Let Me Down\" and \"Get Back.\"The Beatles recorded this in one take. Since they played it live so often, they had it down.This was the last song The Beatles played at a paid concert. Their last show was at Candlestick Park in San Francisco on August 29, 1966. They played a meager bit of \"In My Life\" after it, but gave up and left the stage.The Beatles frequently ended live sets with this.This was the first song Paul McCartney ever played on stage. He was 11 years old and brought his brother up to play it with him. In the early Beatles days, it was his showcase song, and when he toured with his band Wings in 1973, he didn't play any Beatles songs, but did include a version of \"Long Tall Sally.\"This was The Kinks' first single. They decided to record it after seeing the reaction The Beatles got when they played it.The Beatles also covered Little Richard's \"Lucille\" at early concerts. A version can be found on the Live At The BBC album.Larry Williams makes a reference to \"Long Tall Sally\" in his opening lyrics to the song \"Short Fat Fannie.\" The first verse in the song starts out with the lyrics, \"I was slippin' and slidin' with a long tall Sally; Peekin' and a hidin',duck back in the alley.\" (thanks, Zeb - Charlotte, NC)","long_long_long":"George Harrison wrote this and sang all the vocals. The \"you\" in the song refers to God.The Beatles recorded 67 takes.The rattling sound at the end is a bottle of Blue Nun wine that was left on a speaker.The last 30 seconds of this song has been called an audio simulation of Paul's supposed death in 1966. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)","love_me_do":"John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote this in 1958, when John was 17 and Paul was 16. They made time for songwriting by skipping school. They had written songs before, but this was the first one they liked enough to record.McCartney wrote this about his girlfriend at the time, Iris Caldwell.This was the Beatles first single. It was released in England by Parlophone Records, but it took a while before they could get a record company to distribute it in America. The Beatles wanted Capitol Records to release it in the US, but they refused, figuring it would flop. It went to Tollie Records, who released it in America during Beatlemania, about a year after it was released in England.By 1962, The Beatles were playing regular gigs at a club in Hamburg, Germany. They played a lot of Blues covers by famous American artists, and it was a big deal for them when they introduced this into their set, as they didn't know how it would hold up against songs by Little Richard and Ray Charles. The song was well-received and gave The Beatles a lot of confidence, which led to them writing and performing more original songs.When they played this for an audition with Parlophone Records, the producer they auditioned for was George Martin, who became a key figure in Beatles history as he helped shape their sound. He started tinkering with the song right away, adding the harmonica part. Fortunately, John Lennon knew how to play the harmonica and was able to come up with something.The Beatles recorded versions of this song with three different drummers. At their first Parlophone audition in June, 1962, Pete Best was still their drummer. When they recorded it on September 4, Ringo was their drummer, but when George Martin decided it would be the single, he had them record it again a week later. At this session, he used a session drummer named Andy White and stuck Ringo with the tambourine. The version with Ringo drumming was released as the single, but the version released on the album had Andy White's drumming. Ringo didn't pitch a fit when he got bumped at the session, but was very upset and felt real insecure, especially since The Beatles had just fired a drummer.When this was released in England, it was not a big hit. The Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, was so confident in the group that he gave the single a big marketing push by buying a bunch of copies of it (some say 10,000) for his record store, which helped get it on the charts and ensured more exposure for the band.The Beatles were very close to releasing another song as their first single. At their September 4 recording session, George Martin decided their first single should be a song called \"How Do You Do It?,\" which was written by someone else. The Beatles were not pleased and did some lackluster takes of the song before they were allowed to record \"Love Me Do.\" Eventually, Martin changed his mind and went with \"Love Me Do.\" \"How Do You Do It?\" became a hit for Gerry \u0026 the Pacemakers in 1964.Before they recorded this, Lennon always sang the lead vocal, but when his harmonica part was added, McCartney had to sing it because Lennon's mouth was full of harmonica. Paul claims that you can hear the fear in his voice at the audition.John stole the harmonica used in this song in a music shop in Arnhem, a Dutch town near to the German border, while the Beatles were on their way to Hamburg. (thanks, Leo - Hilversum, Netherlands)Lennon's lips went numb from playing the harmonica at session. He was trying to sound like Delbert McClinton.Paul McCartney called this \"Our greatest philosophical song.\"This was recorded in mono on one-track tape. No stereo version exists.This song has been covered by The Brady Bunch, The Chipmunks, Dick Hyman, Flaco Jimenez, Madooo, The Persuasions, Sandie Shaw, Ringo Starr and Bobby Vee. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)When John's Aunt Mimi heard this song, she said to him \"Well, if you think you're going to make a fortune with that, you've got another thing coming.\"According to Q magazine, Parlophone employees weren't impressed when George Martin presented this song to them. One staffer inquired whether English comedian Spike Milligan was behind the record.","love_you_to":"George Harrison wrote this, and aside from some assistance by Ringo Starr on tambourine, is the only Beatle to play on it. (thanks, max - new york, NY)This song features a tabla, which is an Indian drum played with the hands, as well as a sitar. It was the first Beatles song completely based on Indian music. \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\" also used a sitar, but was only partly influenced by Indian music.Harrison was learning the sitar from Ravi Shankar, who inspired him to learn more about Indian music and Eastern religion.In 1968, this was included in The Beatles movie Yellow Submarine.","lovely_rita":"Paul McCartney wrote this as if he fell for a meter maid while she was taking his plate number. Said Paul: \"I was bopping about on the piano in Liverpool when someone told me that in America, they call parking-meter women meter maids. I thought that was great, and it got to 'Rita Meter Maid' and then \"Lovely Rita Meter Maid' and I was thinking vaguely that it should be a hate song: 'You took my car away and I'm so blue today' and you wouldn't be liking her; but then I thought it would be better to love her and if she was very freaky too, like a military man, with a bag on her shoulder. A foot stomper, but nice. The song was imagining if somebody was there taking down my number and I suddenly fell for her, and the kind of person I'd be, to fall for a meter maid, would be a shy office clerk and I'd say, 'May I inquire discreetly when you are free to take some tea with me.' Tea, not pot. It's like saying 'Come and cut the grass' and then realizing that could be pot, or the old teapot could be something about pot. But I don't mind pot and I leave the words in. They're not consciously introduced just to say pot and be clever.\" (from Beatles In Their Own Words)We have a photo of a lovely Meter Maid. See it in Song ImagesMcCartney and Beatles producer George Martin both played pianos. Martin played the honky-tonk style in the middle.Combs and paper were used to create odd background noises.McCartney's vocal was sped-up a bit - one of the many studio tricks employed on the Sgt. Pepper album.Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys told Q magazine that this is his favorite Paul McCartney song. He recalled: \"I had a sneak preview of Sgt. Pepper when Paul came to visit me in 1967 and Lovely Rita made me laugh my head of. I love the way it comes floating in. The bassline is great and the lyrics are kind of funny too.\"","lucy_in_the_sky_with_diamonds":"The \"Lucy\" who inspired this song was Lucy O'Donnell (later Lucy Vodden), who was a classmate of John's son Julian Lennon when he was enrolled at the private Heath House School, in Weybridge, Surrey. It was in a 1975 interview that Lennon said \"Julian came in one day with a picture about a school friend of his named Lucy. He had sketched in some stars in the sky and called it Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.\"The identity of the real Lucy was confirmed by Julian in 2009 when she died of complications from Lupus. Lennon re-connected with her after she appeared on a BBC broadcast where she stated: \"I remember Julian and I both doing pictures on a double-sided easel, throwing paint at each other, much to the horror of the classroom attendant… Julian had painted a picture and on that particular day his father turned up with the chauffeur to pick him up from school.\"Confusion over who was the real Lucy was fueled by a June 15, 2005 Daily Mail article that claimed the \"Lucy\" was Lucy Richardson, who grew up to become a successful movie art director on films such as 2000's Chocolat and 2004's The Life And Death Of Peter Sellers. Richardson died in June 2005 at the age of 47 of breast cancer.Many people thought this was about drugs, since the letters \"LSD\" are prominent in the title, and John Lennon, who wrote it, was known to drop acid. In 1971 Lennon told Rolling Stone that he swore that he had no idea that the song's initials spelt L.S.D. He added: \"I didn't even see it on the label. I didn't look at the initials. I don't look - I mean I never play things backwards. I listened to it as I made it. It's like there will be things on this one, if you fiddle about with it. I don't know what they are. Every time after that though I would look at the titles to see what it said, and usually they never said anything.\"Paul McCartney would later say it was \"pretty obvious\" that this song was inspired by LSD.The images Lennon used in the song were inspired by the imagery in the book Alice In Wonderland.George Harrison played a tambura on this. It's an Indian instrument similar to a sitar that makes a droning noise. He had been studying with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, who is the father of Norah Jones.This was banned by the BBC (British Broadcasting Company) for what they thought were drug references.In 1974, this was a #1 hit for Elton John. Lennon sang and played guitar on his version, but reportedly forgot some of the chords and needed Davey Johnston, Elton John's guitarist, to help him out. Lennon made a surprise appearance in Elton's Thanksgiving concert in New York and performed 3 songs, which proved to be his last public performance. (thanks, Ivan - Dallas, TX)Actor William Shatner, who played Captain Kirk on Star Trek, covered this in his dramatic, spoken-word style. In at least one poll, this version was voted the worst Beatles cover of all time.In 1974, Johanson and Gray named the 3-million-year-old Australopithecus fossil skeleton they discovered (the oldest ever found) Lucy, after this song because it was playing on the radio when Johanson and his team were celebrating the discovery back at camp. (thanks, Martuuuu - Capital Federal, Argentina)Lennon said \"The girl with kaleidoscope eyes\" turned out to be Yoko.During the media controversy over this song in June of 1967, Paul McCartney admitted to a reporter that the band did experiment with LSD. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)In 2004, McCartney addressed the issue of drugs in an interview with the Daily Mirror newspaper: \"'Day Tripper,' that's one about acid. 'Lucy In The Sky,' that's pretty obvious. There are others that make subtle hints about drugs, but it's easy to overestimate the influence of drugs on The Beatles' music. Just about everyone was doing drugs in one form or another, and we were no different, but the writing was too important for us to mess it up by getting off our heads all the time.\"A group called John Fred and his Playboy Band had a #1 hit in 1968 with \"Judy In Disguise (with Glasses),\" a song that was a parody of this.In the Anthology one of the Beatles referred to being on LSD as like seeing through a kaleidoscope. Although Lennon denied this is about drugs, it does refer to \"The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.\" (thanks, delirium trigger - new brunswick, NY)This song is very distinctive musically. It's in 3 different keys and uses 2 different beats. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Lennon admitted to British journalist Ray Connolly in an interview around the time of the break-up of the Beatles that he didn't think he sang this song very well. \"I was so nervous I couldn't sing,\" he said, \"but I like the lyrics.\"In 2004 the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced the discovery of the universe's largest known diamond, white dwarf star BPM 37093. Astronomers gave the star the catchier name of \"Lucy\" from this song.The Flaming Lips covered this as part of their track-for-track tribute to the Sgt. Pepper album, With a Little Help from My Fwends. Their version of this song features Miley Cyrus. Frontman Wayne Coyne told NME: \"On my birthday, Miley Cyrus tweeted me 'Happy Birthday.' I texted back 'Let's do something together.' So we swapped numbers and soon found ourselves in the same studio. I've been around people in the same position to her and they are not fun. She's badass, and she does things with enthusiasm and love.\"","maggie_mae":"This is a traditional song about Liverpool prostitutes (\"Maggie\" is British slang for prostitute). Many British groups have recorded it.The Beatles used to play this when they were still known as The Quarrymen, including at the church fair when John Lennon met Paul McCartney.This was one of the songs they would use to warm up at recording sessions.The Beatles recorded this between takes of \"Two Of Us.\" The album was supposed to be a return to The Beatles early days when they played live, so this was left on. The album was delayed until after The Beatles broke up, so Phil Spector was brought in to produce it from the tapes.This was left off the album when it was released in 2003 without Phil Spector's orchestrations.This was the first song on a Beatles album since Help that was not written by any members of the band. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)Lime Street is a famous street in Liverpool where prostitutes were known to work. (thanks, Loretta - Liverpool, England)When The Beatles released their Let It Be... Naked album in 2003, this song and \"Dig It\" were omitted. The album was a re-release of Let It Be with stripped-down production more in line with Paul McCartney's vision. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","magical_mystery_tour":"A \"Magical Mystery Tour\" was a bus trip to an unknown destination. They were popular in England at the time.Five months after recording this, The Beatles started making a TV special with this as the title track. The special aired in the UK in 1967, but didn't appear in the US until 1976 when it was released in theaters, becoming the fourth Beatles movie. The film, which was an early precursor of today's reality TV shows, didn't go over well with critics or fans. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)When they started recording this, they only had the title, a little bit of music, and the first line. Paul McCartney wrote the verses, John Lennon the refrain. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)The carnival barker at the beginning is Paul McCartney.In the 1978 movie The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash directed by former Monty Python member Eric Idle, this song is parodied by the title \"Tragical History Tour.\" (thanks, Ethan - Franklin, TN)Charles Manson used to refer to life as \"A Magical Mystery Tour\" after hearing this song. He later warped other Beatles songs (\"Helter Skelter,\" \"Piggies,\" \"Blackbird\") to explain a race war named Helter Skelter. He used to say that the Beatles were telling it like it is. (thanks, Breanna - Henderson, NV)","martha_my_dear":"Paul McCartney had a sheepdog named Martha. According to the book A Hard Day's Write, the song is actually about McCartney's \"muse\" - the voice in his head that tells him what words and music to write. He did have a dog named Martha but named her after his muse. Paul Simon wrote about his muse in \"Cecilia\" and Bob Dylan wrote about his in \"Love Minus Zero/No Limit.\" (thanks, Ed - Perth, Australia)Fourteen session musicians were used to play strings and horns.Lennon played guitar on this while Harrison supplied bass. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)One of Martha's offspring can the seen on the cover of McCartney's 1993 album Paul Is Live.Seth Swirsky, who wrote the songs \"Tell It To My Heart\" and \"Love Is a Beautiful Thing,\" produced the Beatles documentary Beatles Stories, where he interviewed over 100 people who crossed paths with the Fab 4. When we asked Seth who his favorite songwriter was, he replied: \"My favorite of all time is Paul McCartney. He could do so many things, and he could do things that are hard to quantify. Some people might say, 'Well, I like Hall and Oates as songwriters,' let's just say. But they do that 8th note thing where they're just banging on the piano, like 'Kiss On My List,' so you could kind of copy their sound a little bit, or copy their style of writing. Very hard to copy McCartney, because you just don't come out with 'Martha My Dear,' where it changes keys in the middle of it.\"A young Stuart Goddard, whose mother used to clean Paul McCartney's apartment in St. John's Wood, would sometimes take the sheepdog Martha for walks. Goddard would grow up to be Adam Ant.","matchbox":"This was first recorded as \"Match Box Blues\" by Blind Lemon Jefferson in 1927. It was reworked by several Blues musicians afterwards. The Beatles' version is influenced by Carl Perkins recording of the song. The Beatles also covered Perkins' \"Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby\" and \"Honey Don't.\"The original first line in the song is \"Sittin' here wonderin' will a matchbox hold my clothes,\" a reference to being poor. Perkins uses this line in his version, but Ringo sings both this line and \"Sittin' here watchin', matchbox hole in my clothes,\" which are erroneously assumed by many to be the real lyrics. There are also verses present which do not exist in Perkins' original, suggesting the group had heard other interpretations.Pete Best, The Beatles original drummer, sang lead on this until he was fired. John Lennon sang it at their Hamburg shows, and Ringo did the lead vocals on the recorded version. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for all above)Carl Perkins was at this session in early June, 1964. In a letter Perkins wrote before he died, he mentioned that he and the Beatles (at their request) played a few of his songs together on this date, but these jams were not taped. The only song he absolutely remembered was \"Your True Love,\" which George Harrison did with Perkins on his cable special. Harrison also sang it at Perkins' memorial service. (thanks, Barry Kesten - Bellmore, United States)Ringo sang this on the 2014 CBS tribute special The Beatles: The Night That Changed America, which aired exactly 50 years after the group made their first Ed Sullivan Show appearance.","maxwells_silver_hammer":"Paul McCartney wrote this song, which is about a medical student (Maxwell Edison) who kills people. The lyric is whimsical dark comedy culled from McCartney's imagination. Growing up, his family loved to make up outrageous stories and tell tall tales, and this seeped into McCartney's songwriting, as he often made up characters for his songs. John Lennon, on the other hand, would usually base his songs on real people and events.Paul McCartney said of this song: \"It epitomizes the downfalls in life. Just when everything is going smoothly, Bang! Bang! Down comes Maxwell's Silver Hammer and ruins everything.\"McCartney played a Moog synthesizer, but there is a much more unusual instrument on this song as well: an anvil. It's a blacksmith's tool that showed up in a lot of those wonderfully violent Looney Tunes cartoons when a heavy object was needed for comic effect. Ringo is the one who banged on the anvil, which was rented from a company that supplied stage props.John Lennon didn't play on this song - he was not at the sessions for this because he was recovering from a car accident. Lennon abased the track in later interviews, saying he hated the song and that McCartney used way too much studio time recording it.McCartney has never implied a specific inspiration for this song, but fans speculated that he was expressing his frustrations with certain people in the band's inner circle, perhaps hoping that a figurative hammer would crash down on Yoko Ono or their manager, Allen Klein.The recording sessions went on for three days (July 9-11, 1969) as McCartney tried to get it just right. This strained his already tense relationship with the Beatles, who broke up soon after recording Abbey Road. In a 2008 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Ringo Starr said, \"The worst session ever was 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer.' It was the worst track we ever had to record. It went on for f--king weeks. I thought it was mad.\" (thanks, VinnyVegas - Durham, NC)The Beatles performed this in their movie Let It Be.The cover of the album fueled rumors that Paul McCartney was dead. The cover shows all four Beatles walking in a crosswalk of Abbey Road. John is leading, followed by Ringo, Paul, and finally George. According to the rumor, what they were wearing signified a funeral procession. John was dressed in white as if he was God, Ringo was dressed in a black suit as if he was a Preacher, and George was wearing grungy clothing, as if he was the grave digger. Paul was dressed in a dark-gray suit, was carrying a cigarette, and has his eyes closed. Also, he is the only one walking barefoot. (thanks, Patrick - Conyers, GA)This originally opened with a brief instrumental intro that was edited out. It used the same chords as the ending of the song. (thanks, Barry Kesten - Bellmore, United States)McCartney's handwritten lyrics for this song were sold at auction for $192,000. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","mean_mr_mustard":"John Lennon wrote most of this when he was in India at the Maharishi's meditation camp with the other Beatles in 1967. He didn't think much of the song, calling it and \"Polythene Pam\" \"finished bits of crap that I wrote in India.\"Lennon got the idea for this song from a newspaper article he read about a miser who hid his cash everywhere so nobody could find it.The Beatles recorded this as one song with \"Sun King.\" It's part of a suite of songs at the end of Abbey Road. The Beatles considered using this on The White Album, but decided not to.","michelle":"John Lennon invited McCartney over to college parties when he was still in high school, and French culture was a trend. Paul would try to fit in by sitting in a corner and pretending to be French. He would play little tunes in French, but he only knew a few French words so he would groan or make words up. John told him that he should make it into a real song for Rubber Soul, so he asked his friend Ivan Vaughan, whose wife was a French teacher, for a French name and some words to rhyme with it. Vaughan came up with \"Michelle, ma belle.\" McCartney came up with the next line, \"These are words that go together well,\" and Vaughan taught him the French translation, \"Sont des mots qui vont tres bien ensemble,\" which he used in the song as well. When he played it for Lennon, John suggested the \"I love you\" part in the middle. (thanks, Klasic Rok - Battle Ground, WA)This is not based on any particular woman. They chose the name because it sounded good.None of The Beatles spoke French. They picked up some German when they went there in 1962, but no French.This won a Grammy in 1966 for Song of the Year, one of just four Grammys The Beatles won while they were still active.In France, this went to #1.McCartney mailed a check to Ivan Vaughn's wife, Jan, for helping with the French lyrics. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)The French verse is often misheard as \"Sunday monkey won't play piano song.\" (thanks, Patrick - Tallapoosa, GA)Paul McCartney said in Observer Music Monthly October 2007: \"We used to go to these art school parties because John was at art school and me and George were at the school next door, which is now a performing arts school. John was that little bit older than us, which at that age is impressive. He was a year-and-a-half older than me and you really look up to people like that. But it's funny because I don't think I had that same feeling with Ringo, who I think was a few months older than John. John was a pretty impressive cat - being a year-and-a-half older and going to art school, all that was a pretty cool combination for us. So we'd tag along to these parties, and it was at the time of people like Juliette Greco, the French bohemian thing. They'd all wear black turtleneck sweaters, it's kind of where we got all that from, and we fancied Juliette like mad. Have you ever seen her? Dark hair, real chanteuse, really happening. So I used to pretend to be French, and I had this song that turned out later to be 'Michelle.' It was just an instrumental, but years later John said: 'You remember that thing you wrote about the French?' I said: 'Yeah.' He said: 'That wasn't a bad song, that. You should do that, y'know.'\"Singer-songwriter Michelle Branch was named after this song. (thanks, George - Calumet City, IL)When Paul McCartney received the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song award at a White House ceremony in 2010, he did something he later said he'd been itching to do for a while: sing \"Michelle\" to the First Lady. President Obama credited McCartney with helping \"to lay the soundtrack for an entire generation.\" For his part, Sir Paul managed to work in a line hinting at his view of American presidential politics. \"After the last eight years, \" he joked, \"it's great to have a president who knows what a library is.\" McCartney is the third recipient of the award - Paul Simon and Stevie Wonder are previous honorees - which recognizes songwriters \"whose careers reflect a lifetime achievement in promoting song as a vehicle of artistic expression and cultural understanding.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","misery":"John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote this for Helen Shapiro, a 16 year old who toured with The Beatles in 1963. Her management rejected the song, but another singer on that tour, Kenny Lynch, did record it, becoming the first person to cover a Lennon/McCartney song. The Beatles recorded this themselves when they needed material for their Please Please Me album, which was quickly released in the UK to capitalize on the success of their first two singles: \"Please Please Me\" and \"Love Me Do.\"Kenny Lynch had a successful career as a recording artist in the UK, achieving seven Top 40 hits, including the #10 charting cover of The Drifters' \"Up on The Roof.\" Later Lynch became better known as a TV presenter and songwriter (he co-wrote Small Faces' #3 hit \"Sha La La La Lee\"). Lynch established another link with McCartney when he appeared on the sleeve of Wings' Band on the Run album.The Beatles were in such a rush to cram material on the new Please Please Me album that they picked up several covers. One was written by Brill Building legends Gerry Goffin and Carole King, titled \"Chains,\" and another was The Shirelles' hit \"Boys.\" \"Misery\" was one of the eight original songs on the album.Turning down a Lennon/McCartney song seems a little ridiculous, but Helen Shapiro, whom they wrote this song for, was a top-selling female vocalist in the UK, and was putting together a Country-Western album and her manager contacted The Beatles to ask if they could write a song for her. They offered him \"Misery,\" but he turned it down as it didn't fit her sound. The Beatles weren't a huge deal at the time, so the manager didn't see the potential in the song.This song also appears on the sought-after EP single The Beatles (No. 1), which features this song, \"I Saw Her Standing There,\" \"Anna (Go to Him),\" and \"Chains.\"The American release of the Please Please Me album was Introducing... The Beatles. Compare and contrast the two album covers for an idea of how they were marketed; the UK cover has a playful shot of the Fab Four peeking over a balcony, while the US cover has a far more conventional pose standing and sitting in suits that make them almost seem like a '50s doo-wop group. Can't go scaring those conservative Americans by making your group seem to \"challenging,\" now.","money_thats_what_i_want":"This Motown classic was originally recorded by Barrett Strong in 1959. Strong became a writer for Motown, and worked on some of The Temptations' hits. The song was written by Motown chief Berry Gordy with help from an assistant at the company, Janie Bradford.The Beatles performed this at their audition for Decca Records in 1962. They didn't get the deal, but were singned on their next audition, which was for Parlophone Records. Decca did sign Brian Poole And The Tremeloes.Beatles producer George Martin played the piano. John Lennon sang lead.Speaking of money, Paul McCartney is the wealthiest rock star ever, earning over a billion dollars in his career.Along with \"You've Really Got A Hold On Me\" and \"Please Mr. Postman,\" this was one of three Motown songs the The Beatles released on their second album, titled With The Beatles in the UK and The Beatles' Second Album in the US. Berry Gordy, who ran Motown Records, was thrilled that The Beatles thought highly enough of Motown to record their songs.","mother_natures_son":"Paul McCartney wrote this in India after the Maharishi gave a speech about nature. The 4 Beatles were attending the camp to learn transcendental meditation, but were not impressed with the results. John Lennon's demo \"Child of Nature,\" which he later re-worked into \"Jealous Guy,\" was similarly inspired by Maharishi's lecture.McCartney recorded this by himself after the other Beatles had left the studio.Paul McCartney told Mojo magazine October 2008 that Nat King Cole's 1948 standard \"Nature Boy\" influenced this gentle pastoral, \"because that's a song I love.\" He added: \"At that time I considered myself a guy leaning towards the countryside. But I would have to tip a wink to Nature Boy. Though, when you think about it, the only thing they have in common is the word 'nature'- the rest of the link is pretty tenuous.\"John Denver recorded this in 1972. He was going to name his album after this song, but changed it when he came up with the song \"Rocky Mountain High.\"The song's bongo-style percussion sound was achieved by miking up the drums in the Abbey Road corridor.","mr_moonlight":"The original version of this was released by a Blues group called Dr. Feelgood and The Interns in 1962. It was written by Roy Lee Johnson, who was a guitarist with The Interns. This original version the song was a B-side to the single \"Dr. Feelgood\" (no relation to the Motley Crue album and song of the same name), by the aforementioned group. As if that didn't muddy the waters enough, there's also a TV series Moonlight with an episode titled \"Dr. Feelgood,\" which appears to be a complete coincidence.The song is best known for its Beatles cover, but even among hardcore Beatles fans, this song doesn't have as much enthusiastic support. It was part of their standard stage set for many years, in part because it gave John a chance to show off his blistering vocals on stage.George Harrison played the African Drum, and Paul McCartney played the Hammond organ solo on this track. The sound of a Hammond organ sounds quite dated now, but they were a big rage back in the mid-20th century. The electric organs were manufactured from the 1930s to the 1970s, by which time they were a staple of every shopping mall, where the organ store would often feature bored showroom employees plonking out show tunes. The organs were widely popular for being a cheap alternative to pipe organs, and thus easily affordable for churches.","no_reply":"This was one of John Lennon's first songs to tell a complete story. The boy knocks on his girl's door, knows she is home because he sees her in the window, but she does not answer. Lennon wrote the song when he was inspired by the song \"Silhouettes.\" He said, \"I had that image of walking down the street and seeing her silhouetted in the window and not answering the phone.\" Music publisher Dick James told Lennon that it was the first \"complete\" song that John had ever written: It had a beginning and an end.This starts with a vocal, which was rare for the time.This was yet another early Beatles song originally written for another artist. \"No Reply\" was written for Tommy Quickly, another Liverpudlian who was also signed to Beatles manager Brian Epstein. Quickly never recorded and released the song, so the Beatles used it themselves. Quickly's story rapidly deteriorated; he had a number of singles that failed to chart, then one minor hit, \"Wild Side of Life,\" before fading back into obscurity. This Mersey Beat article seems to indicate that he just wasn't cut out for the spotlight.This song's demo recording was lost due to a filing error, then found again by 1993 and re-released on Anthology 1.That's record producer George Martin tickling the ivories. Meanwhile, on the demo version, Ringo was absent from the recording session; he was laid up with tonsillitis and pharyngitis. Jimmie Nicol might have done the drum work here, since he was also drafted to replace Ringo on their upcoming tour. Ringo was back at his station by the time this album version was recorded.","norwegian_wood_this_bird_has_flown":"This was the first pop song to use a sitar - George Harrison played it. Harrison was new to the sitar and took many takes to get it right. He bought the instrument, which he described as \"crummy,\" and taught himself to play. It was David Crosby of The Byrds who introduced Harrison to the sitar shortly after the folk musician Shawn Phillips had shown him the basic steps. A few months later, Harrison studied the sitar with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, who helped Harrison explore Eastern music and religion.In an interview with Rolling Stone in 1971, John Lennon explained why it was decided to use the sitar on this song. He recalled: \"I think it was at the studio. George had just got the sitar and I said 'Could you play this piece?' We went through many different sort of versions of the song, it was never right and I was getting very angry about it, it wasn't coming out like I said. They said, 'Well just do it how you want to do it' and I said, 'Well I just want to do it like this.' They let me go and I did the guitar very loudly into the mike and sang it at the same time and then George had the sitar and I asked him could he play the piece that I'd written, you know, dee diddley dee diddley dee, that bit, and he was not sure whether he could play it yet because he hadn't done much on the sitar but he was willing to have a go, as is his wont, and he learned the bit and dubbed it on after. I think we did it in sections.\"John Lennon said of this song: \"I was trying to write about an affair without letting my wife know I was having one. I was sort of writing from my experiences - girl's flats, things like that. I was very careful and paranoid because I didn't want my wife, Cyn, to know that there really was something going on outside of the household. I'd always had some kind of affairs going on, so I was trying to be sophisticated in writing about an affair, but in such a smoke-screen way that you couldn't tell. But I can't remember any specific woman it had to do with.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Norwegian Wood is a fake wood that was used to make cheap furniture. John Lennon Lennon claimed he had no idea where the title came from, but Paul McCartney said he came up with it, inspired by the Norwegian Wood in the Asher household, where he was staying. McCartney was dating Jane Asher, and was good friends with her brother, Peter Asher from the duo Peter \u0026 Gordon.There are not many lyrics in this song, but they tell the story of a man who gets invited to a girl's house. When she won't let him into her bed, he sleeps in the tub. When she leaves the next morning, he sets the place on fire. It was one of the first songs Lennon wrote that told a complete story.The Beatles recorded this on October 12, 1965, the first day of the Rubber Soul sessions. The first take of the song, which is included on the Anthology 2 CD and includes George's sitar much more prominently, was originally going to be put on Rubber Soul until a remake was made a week or two later. The notes in the Anthology 2 album verify this. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)Ringo played the finger cymbals.Bob Dylan wrote a parody of this song called \"4th Time Around.\"It was Paul McCartney who came up with the album title Rubber Soul. Lennon told Rolling Stone that he supposed it was a pun meaning English Soul. He added: \"There is no great mysterious meaning behind all of this, it was just four boys working out what to call a new album.\"Some of the many artists to cover this song include José Feliciano, Herbie Hancock and Buddy Rich. The mellow rap group P.M. Dawn also did a version on their 1993 The Bliss Album.","nowhere_man":"John Lennon came up with this after struggling to write a song for the album. Said Lennon: \"I thought of myself sitting there, doing nothing and getting nowhere.\"This was used in the animated Beatles movie Yellow Submarine. They sing it to Jeremy Hillary Boob, PhD, who describes himself as an \"eminent physicist, polyglot classicist, prize-winning botanist, hard-biting satirist, talented pianist, good dentist too.\" The Beatles decide to take him Somewhere, and he eventually helps them to defeat the Blue Meanies. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)This starts with a 3 part harmony sung by Lennon, Harrison, and McCartney.This is probably the first Beatles song that has nothing to do with love.Typical of many John Lennon compositions are the \"falling\" melodies, which can be heard in \"Nowhere Man.\" Folk music often has falling melodies, indicating melancholy. In Baroque music, a falling melody means sadness. (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm)There is a very audible feedback 38 seconds into the song after the word \"missin'.\"Natalie Merchant performed this at the 2001 special, Come Together: A Night For John Lennon's Words And Music. She did a mellow version, as the show was also a tribute to victims of the terrorist attacks on America.In a 1971 interview with Rolling Stone, Lennon recalled the background to this song: \"I remember I was just going through this paranoia trying to write something and nothing would come out so I just lay down and tried to not write and then this came out, the whole thing came out in one gulp.\"In 2003, John Lennon's original handwritten lyrics to this song were auctioned at Christie's of New York for $455,500. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","obladi_oblada":"The title comes from a Reggae band called Jimmy Scott and his Obla Di Obla Da Band. Says McCartney, \"A fella who used to hang around the clubs used to say in a Jamaican accent, \"Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on,\" and he got annoyed when I did a song of it, 'cause he wanted a cut. I said, 'Come on, Jimmy, it's just an expression.\" (thanks, Chiara - West Vancouver, Canada)When Jimmy Scott needed money for bail (he was jailed for missing alimony payments), McCartney had his friend Alistair Taylor put up the money in exchange for Scott dropping rights to the name. Taylor had to get the money from a friend, since no one in the Beatles camp carried much cash. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Paul McCartney wrote this and The Beatles spent a great deal of time recording and overdubbing it. John, George, and Ringo became very annoyed. Harrison hinted at his frustration on \"Savoy Truffle,\" which was recorded three months later. In the song he wrote; \"But what is sweet now, turns so sour/ We all know Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da/ But can you show me, where you are?\"John Lennon hated this song. He didn't like a lot of McCartney's later songs with The Beatles, feeling they were trite and meaningless. Ringo and George disliked this too and all three of them vetoed Paul's wish that this be released as a single.This was a #1 hit in England for Marmalade in 1968. With this song, Marmalade became the first Scottish group to top the UK charts (leaving little doubt about their origin, they performed the song on Top Of The Pops wearing kilts). It also could be considered the first UK #1 to be done in a Reggae style. Marmalade's bassist Graham Knight recalls in 1000 UK #1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh, \"The Beatles' music publisher, Dick James, played us the acetate of The Beatles' Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da and we thought it was great. He said, 'You can have it, I won't give it to anyone else,' but of course he passed it to another 27 acts. We rush-recorded it in the middle of the night during a week of cabaret in the north-east. Our manager, who was in America at the time, kept sending us telegrams not to do it. He didn't think we should record a Beatles song. We expected it to do well, but we didn't think it would go to #1. We got no feedback from The Beatles at all. There had been so many covers by that time that I shouldn't think they'd have been very interested.\" (thanks, Edward Pearce - Ashford, Kent, England)The guitars were over-modulated on purpose to get the desired effect.This was one of the first songs with a Reggae beat to have pop success.Paul mistakenly sang \"Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face.\" It was intended to be \"Molly,\" but Paul decided to leave it in to create confusion.John Lennon played the piano part on this song.After doing a huge number of takes (around 60), Paul continued on trying to record this as a slow song. John was in the other room listening while doing drugs. After getting high, he was very frustrated to hear Paul record it slow so many times. He subsequently burst into the recording room, pushed Paul aside and got on the piano playing the song very fast and upbeat. The fast and happy recording on the infamous White Album is the result. (Thanks to Charles Barrows) (thanks, Bompsy - Madison, WI)This was used as the theme to the TV series Life Goes On. It was sung by Patti LuPone and the rest of the cast.The melody of this song was later used by The Offspring in their song \"Why don't you get a job?\" (thanks, Austin - Brooklyn Park, MN)In December 1968, a version by The Bedrocks hit #20 in the UK.The Beatles never performed this live, as they stopped touring in 1966, but Paul McCartney did play it live - eventually. He included it in his setlist for the first time on his 2010 \"Up And Coming\" tour.The author Paul Saltzman, who was studying Transcendental Meditation in Rishikesh, India with The Beatles in February 1968, published a photo book on his time with the band called The Beatles In India, where Saltzman recalled watching McCartney and Lennon collaborating on the song. Wrote Saltzman: \"I looked over and under Paul's toe, under his sandal was a little torn piece of paper. And I look over and in his handwriting it's 'Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da, bra/La-La how the life goes on.' And I'm sitting beside Ringo (Starr) - maybe five feet away from Paul - and they start singing it and really working with it. Only those words -- only John and Paul. Ringo was just quietly listening.\" (thanks, DeeTheWriter - Saint Petersburg, Russia Federation, for above 2)","octopuss_garden":"Along with \"Don't Pass Me By,\" this was one of two songs Ringo Starr wrote for The Beatles. It came about when Ringo left The White Album sessions in 1968 and went on a boating trip with his family in Sardina. The boat's captain offered him an octopus lunch, but he turned it down. It was then that the captain began to tell him everything he knew about octopuses, and how they travel along the sea bed looking for shiny objects and stones with which to build gardens. Ringo thought about how tranquil it would be to live down there amongst your friends in the calm waters - the opposite of the chaos and internecine conflict he was going through with The Beatles. With this idea, he wrote the song about living in the octopus's garden.Ringo did return to his post for The White Album, discovering his drum kit covered with flowers to welcome him back (George Harrison's idea). The Beatles completed that album and later included \"Octopus's Garden\" on Abbey Road.This is one of the most kid-friendly Beatles songs. Ringo sang lead, as he did on some of the lighter Beatles songs, including \"Yellow Submarine\" and \"Act Naturally.\" His voice is very appealing to children, as demonstrated in his later voiceover work on Thomas the Tank Engine.George Harrison helped Ringo write this during the Let It Be sessions. They are seen working on it in the movie Let It Be - George rewrote the chord sequence.Ringo made the underwater sounds by blowing bubbles through a glass of water.","oh_darling":"Paul McCartney wrote this song. He came to the studio early every day for a week to sing it because his voice was too clear. He wanted it to sound strained, like he had been performing it all week.McCartney had deployed the retro shredded-voice form several times before; once each on \"I'm Down,\" \"Long Tall Sally,\" and \"Helter Skelter.\" Perhaps a bit of artistic rivalry was afoot here - hard rock vocals had been the domain of John, and Paul seemed almost to be pushing himself to compete.Lennon resented that Paul didn't let him sing lead vocals. He felt it was more his style, but since McCartney wrote it, it was his decision. In a 1980 Playboy interview, Lennon even shot down McCartney's vocal efforts, specifically stating that he could have done it better.The Beatles performed this in their movie Let It Be. While rehearsing the song for the film, John announced that Yoko's divorce with her former husband had finally gone through and he improvised a verse about that. This can be heard on The Beatles Anthology 3. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)One of the reasons McCartney could arrive at the studio so early was because he only lived two blocks away from Abbey Road. Incidentally, this also factors into why he was barefoot on the album cover for Abbey Road. He'd just worn sandals and happened to slip them off. Next thing you know, hundreds of \"Paul is dead\" rumors.\"Oh! Darling\" draws its influence equally from New-Orleans-style R\u0026B popularized by Fats Domino, and the \"swamp\" style of blues popular in Louisiana at the time. The rest of the group added the doo-wop harmony after the fact.","old_brown_shoe":"George Harrison wrote this song and also played guitar, organ and bass on the track; it was one of the few times he included a guitar solo for himself. Regarding the words, opposites were a common theme in Harrison's lyrics: right/wrong, short/tall. He explained: \"I started the chord sequences on the piano, which I don't really play, and then began writing ideas for the words from various opposites... Again, it's the duality of things - yes no, up down, left right, right wrong, etcetera.\"This was released as the B-side of \"The Ballad of John and Yoko.\"The album cover to the single echoes the album cover for Hey Jude in a clever way. On the single version for \"The Ballad of John and Yoko,\" John and Yoko are seated on a pair of statues, while the rest of the group, looking rather forlorn, stand in the background. On the cover of Hey Jude, all four Beatles stand indoors in a classical setting flanked by statues - one of which off to the side wears Yoko's hat.Even fans argue to this day whether that's George's or Paul's bass work. The various editing sessions in the studio muddy the waters quite a bit. To wit: During the Let It Be sessions, the group did two recordings, one with Harrison and piano accompaniment, and one with the whole group plus Billy Preston. They rehearsed the song eight more times for these sessions, and there's some bootlegs of these tapes out there. Then a complicated hail of edits on different tracks ensued when they actually went to record \"Old Brown Shoe,\" with Harrison replacing two guitar tracks with his own and wiping Lennon's rhythm guitar in favor of a Hammond organ. Remember that this was towards the end of the Beatles' career, and there were growing creative fractures in the band. For the record, Harrison told a Creem interview that that's his bass.","one_after_909":"According to disc 2 of the 2003 release Let It Be... Naked, This is about a lady who tells her boyfriend that she is leaving on the train that leaves after train number 909. He begs her not to go, but she does anyway. He packs his bags and rushes after her and discovers that she is not on \"the one after 909.\" He goes home depressed and goes into the wrong house. (thanks, Loretta - Liverpool, England)John Lennon wrote this in 1959. It was one of his first songs. He penned the tune during a visit to his grandparents' three-bedroom terrace house at 9 Newcastle Road, Wavertree, Liverpool. He had spent the first five years of his life living there with his parents and grandparents.Part of The Beatles' early live repertoire, this ended up on their last album. The album was going to be titled \"Get Back\" and was supposed to be The Beatles getting back to their roots and playing live. It didn't work out that way, and by the time the album was released, The Beatles had broken up and \"Let It Be\" was chosen as the title. It was included on the album because The Beatles performed it twice in the movie Let It Be, including the impromptu concert on Apple Records' rooftop.The Beatles recorded this in 1963, but did not get a take they liked. The version on Anthology 1 was pieced together from the 1963 takes. (thanks, Loretta - Liverpool, England)","only_a_northern_song":"George Harrison wrote this. He called it, \"A joke relating to Liverpool, the Holy City in the North of England.\" Liverpool is north of London.Harrison used some real wit and humor in composing this (remember, out of all the Beatles, he was closest with Monty Python and Python alumnus Terry Gilliam, to the point of composing the closing theme to Time Bandits). In this song, he picks out a haphazard series of chords when he starts singing \"it really doesn't matter...\", with a B-melody note, E chord, B minor 7th, G chord, C-sharp 7th, F-sharp 7th. It sounds chaotic at first, but there's order underneath, expressing that he felt that he was buried brilliance over-shadowed by the Lennon-McCartney dominance.The above intricate joke is even lampshaded by the lyric: \"You may think the chords are going wrong. But they're not; He just wrote it like that.\"Northern Songs was The Beatles publishing company, so they were in charge of paying royalties to the songwriters. Harrison had a bad deal and didn't always get a fair share of the publishing royalties. He took out those frustrations in this song.Rumor has it that George wrote this song in about an hour in the middle of the night while an orchestra was waiting for him. The producer of the Yellow Submarine film needed one more song as filler and George volunteered to go write one. The song, however, was written in February of 1967 when they were working on Sgt. Pepper. To quote Steve Turner in his book A Hard Day's Write, \"The song was a sly dig at the business arrangements of the Beatles. Their songs had always been published by Northern Songs Ltd, 30% of whose shares belonged to John and Paul with Ringo and George owning only 1.6% each. This meant that John and Paul, in addition to being the groups main songwriters, were benefiting again as prime shareholders in the publishing company. As far as Northern Songs was concerned, George was merely a contracted writer.\"So, as far as George was concerned, it didn't matter what he wrote because the bulk of the money was going into other people's pockets. In the beginning, this didn't bother him, but when he started to feel that his songs were actually good, that's when he started feeling screwed.Technically, \"Only a Northern Song\" is one of The Beatles' most psychedelic songs, including the use of such eccentric instruments as timpani, glockenspiel and chimes. There's also a mix of two version of the same rhythm track, causing a phasing effect. The stuttering, distorted trumpets were added later. The Beatles were becoming more competent sound studio engineers with every album, and were also finding it hard to resist overproducing their tracks.The working title of this song was \"Not Known.\"","ps_i_love_you":"Paul McCartney wrote this song in Hamburg, Germany while The Beatles were the house band at The Star Club, where they spent much of 1962 improving their skills with constant live performances. An early favorite, the band performed the song at their Parlophone Records audition on June 6, 1962.A very early Beatles song, this is a great example of how the group forged a very personal relationship with their fans through songs that spoke directly to the listener. The words \"I,\" \"You,\" \"Me\" and \"Love\" show up in many of their early hits, creating a strong connection between band and listener.This was used as the B-side of \"Love Me Do,\" the first Beatles release in England. It was going to be their first single, but Peggy Lee had a song out with the same title so the record company decided to release \"Love Me Do\" instead.In 2007, a movie called P.S. I Love You was released starring Hilary Swank, Lisa Kudrow and Gerald Butler.Please Please Me is the only Beatles album with the original songs credited to \"McCartney/Lennon\"; hereafter (and in subsequent releases of this album on CD), they would be credited as the more familiar \"Lennon/McCartney.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","paperback_writer":"Paul McCartney wrote this after helping some friends, including John Dunbar, set up the Indica Bookshop (in the basement was the Indica Gallery, where John Lennon eventually met Yoko Ono), in January of 1966. Paul was the first customer of the shop.This song was a sort of an homage to lots of authors, including John Lennon, who had already written two books: In His Own Write and A Spaniard In The Works. He also was thinking of the author Martin Amis, whom he had just developed a passion for. (thanks, Megan - Albany, NY)The song is sung from the perspective of an author soliciting a publisher. A \"paperback\" is cheaper than a traditional hardcover book, and at the time was considered of lower quality and written for mass consumption. The implication is that the writer isn't all that good.The first #1 hit for The Beatles that was not about love.John Lennon and George Harrison sang the French nursery rhyme \"Frére Jacques\" in the background. The Frére Jacques part has nothing to do with John Lennon - Paul just thought it was clever - but it does translate to \"Brother John.\"The B-side to this single was John Lennon's \"Rain.\" Paul and John would always compete for the A-side of The Beatles singles. (thanks, Todd Van Luling - Herndon, VA)Lennon claimed this was \"the brother of Day Tripper,\" meaning the song was based on a \"dirty\" sounding guitar lick. The Beatles released \"Day Tripper\" the previous year. (thanks, Chet - Saratoga Springs, NY)McCartney's bass was boosted by using a loudspeaker as its microphone and positioning it in front of the bass speaker. There was some concern that the heavy bass line would make record players skip.The ad for the single in England used the \"butcher cover,\" showing The Beatles holding parts of bloody dolls. It caused a stir in America when it was used for the Yesterday and Today album, which Columbia Records pulled from stores soon after release and is now a collector's item. If you own an early copy of Yesterday... And Today with the non-controversial cover, you might have something valuable with a little trick: according to Bill Cody, who worked at the Harmony Record Shop in Colorado, the new covers were put over the originals, and it is possible to steam them off to reveal the butcher covers. At Harmony Records, this is what they did with their shipment, allowing them to sell the albums for $5.99 instead of the original $2.99.This was a song that led the transition from early Beatles style to later Beatles style, from love songs to opening up the subject of songs to a wider variety of subjects. Paul's Aunt had been bugging him for months, challenging him to \"Write a song that wasn't about love.\" So he wrote this just to shut her up. He said: \"We always try to do something different. And this idea's a bit different. Years ago my Auntie Lil said to me, 'Why can't you ever write about a horse or the summit conference or something interesting? So I thought, 'All right, Auntie Lil. I'll show you.\" (thanks, Mike - Mountlake Terrace, WA. U.S.A)Ringo's bass drum was emphasized on this track. A microphone was placed an inch away to make it boom.On the Beatles' lone appearance on BBC's long-running music show Top Of The Pops, they performed this song with George Harrison mysteriously miming to \"Frére Jacques.\"The single's picture sleeve showed both Lennon and Harrison playing left-handed as Capitol's art department mistakenly reversed their photos.This claimed the top spot in the US for two non-consecutive weeks; it was interrupted for one week by Frank Sinatra's \"Strangers in the Night.\"By this time, The Beatles were about to cease touring and couldn't make many TV appearances to perform the song. This made it very difficult to promote the single, so they commissioned a film clip that could be shown on these programs in their stead, unwittingly creating one of the first music videos.The clip was shot at Chiswick House in London, which is famous for its lavish gardens. The setting made an interesting backdrop, but the focus was on the band, with the guys getting lots of close-ups and appearing in various cool poses. A video for the flip side of the single, \"Rain,\" was shot at the same time.The clip first aired in the US, appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show on June 5, 1966. Black-and-white versions later aired in the UK on Thank Your Lucky Stars and Ready, Steady, Go!The video was directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who worked on various UK television shows, including Ready, Steady,Go!, where he fell in with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. He became arguably the first music video director when these bands hired him to make promotional films; after doing \"Paperback Writer,\" he also did \"Hey Jude\" and \"Revolution,\" as well as several productions for The Stones, including their Rock and Roll Circus special.As revealed in the Beatles 1+ reissue, Lindsay-Hogg pitched a conceptual video for \"Paperback Writer\" envisioning Paul McCartney as an aspiring novelist. The band's manager, Brian Epstein, killed the idea, becoming perhaps the first band manager to quash a clever concept video in favor of just showing the band performing the song in an exotic location.","penny_lane":"Paul McCartney was sitting at a bus shelter waiting for John Lennon to meet him on Penny Lane, a street near their houses. While sitting there Paul jotted down the things he saw, including a barber's shop with pictures of its clients and a nurse selling poppies for Remembrance Day (November 11th or the day World War 1 officially ended). He later turned these into the song we now know. Penny Lane still contains the bank and barber's shop mentioned in the song, however the shelter in the middle of the roundabout where the nurse sells the poppies has now become a restaurant named Sgt. Pepper's Bistro. (thanks, James - St. Albans, England)While the song is called \"Penny Lane\" and is a road in Liverpool, the song is really a reference to the Penny Lane Bus Station (now gone) next to \"The shelter in the middle of the roundabout\" (now the Sgt. Peppers bistro). When the boys were young they used to meet at this bus station as it was a hub to get them anywhere else they wanted to go and was centrally located to all of them. Please see the Penny Lane Song Images for more.The trumpet part was added after the rest of the song was finished. McCartney was watching the BBC when he saw a group called The New Philharmonia perform Bach's \"Brandenburg Concerto #2.\" He got the idea to add a trumpet part, and asked the group's trumpet player, Dave Mason, to play on this. Mason brought 9 trumpets to the session, eventually deciding to use a B-flat piccolo trumpet. Mason, who is not the same Dave Mason from the group Traffic, played on a few other Beatles songs, including \"A Day In The Life,\" \"Magical Mystery Tour,\" and \"All You Need Is Love.\"Dave Mason played some trumpet for the end of the song, but it was cut out from the final release. It did make it onto the promotional single sent to radio stations, and was also used in the mix released on the Anthology album. Mason died on April 29, 2011 at age 85.John Lennon played piano and George Harrison played the conga drum. There is no guitar.There are some obscene references in this song that were intentional - \"Finger Pie\" and \"keeps his fire engine clean\" were sexual slang.The first time The Beatles appeared with facial hair was in the promotional film for this song. The clip shows the band on horseback, trotting around Angel Lane in London (not Penny Lane). By this time, the group had stopped touring, so the only way many fans could see them perform was on music videos like this one. A restored version of the video appears on the 1+ compilation, released in 2015.Street signs on Penny Lane in Liverpool began disappearing after this was released. The town painted \"Penny Lane\" on buildings to avoid theft.This was the Beatles' first single since \"Please Please Me\" 4 years earlier that didn't hit #1 in England.This and \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" were intended for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, but Capitol Records decided to release the two songs as a single, partly to regain popularity from John Lennon's \"The Beatles are bigger than Jesus\" comment. (thanks, Julian - Anaheim, CA)In the movie Almost Famous, Penny Lane is the name of one of the groupies. Kate Hudson was nominated for an Oscar for the role.Lennon's mother Julia at one time worked as a cinema usher and a waitress in Penny Lane. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Penny Lane in Liverpool England is named after James Penny, an 18th century slave ship owner. (thanks, kelso - mission control, Africa)The trumpet that David Jones played on this track was sold at auction in 1987 for the equivalent of nearly $11,000. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)The lyric \"pretty nurse selling poppies from a tray\" is believed to refer to Beth Davidson, who married Lennon's boyhood friend, Pete Shotton.The reference to the barber, with \"photographs of every head he's had the pleasure to have known,\" was later identified as James Bioletti, who used to cut the hair of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison when they were children.The \"banker in a motor car\" on the other hand was invented by McCartney for the simple reason that it rhymed.Providing some perspective on this song and the songwriting talents of Paul McCartney, Seth Swirsky, who produced the Beatles documentary Beatles Stories and spent years as a staff songwriter for Chappell Music, told us: \"He could do so many things, and he could do things that are hard to quantify. Some people might say, 'Well, I like Hall and Oates as songwriters,' let's just say. But they do that 8th note thing where they're just banging on the piano, like 'Kiss On My List,' so you could kind of copy their sound a little bit, or copy their style of writing. Very hard to copy McCartney, because you just don't come out with 'Penny Lane,' where it just changes keys. It's out of a different kind of brain.\" (Check out our full interview with Seth Swirsky.)","piggies":"George Harrison wrote this song as a takedown of the upper crust, who he felt could be greedy and slovenly. The Beatles were already rich and famous, but came from very humble beginnings - Harrison grew up in a working-class family in Liverpool.Harrison intended this as social commentary, but many people interpreted it as an anti-police anthem. Charles Manson, in his very disturbed mind, thought the term \"damn good whacking\" meant against the American police. During the murders of Sharon Tate, the LaBianca's and others, knives and forks were used to stab them because these utensils were mentioned in the song. The words \"pig and piggy,\" were written with the victims' blood on the walls. Harrison was horrified when he learned his song took on another meaning. (thanks, Dominic - Pittsburgh, PA)John Lennon did not play on this, but he improved this slightly with the line, \"Clutching forks and knives they eat their bacon\" - adding a touch of cannibalism to the proceedings. This replaced the line, \"Clutching forks and knives to cut their pork chops\" which can be heard on Anthology 3. The pig noises were his idea. (thanks, Mike - Mountlake Terrace, WA. U.S.A)This keeps the animal theme between \"Blackbird\" and \"Rocky Raccoon\" on The White Album.There was an extra verse that wasn't included on the song. It goes:\"Everywhere there's lots of piggies playing piggie pranksYou can see them on their trottersAt the piggy banksPaying piggy thanksTo thee pig brother.\" (thanks, James - Ashland, OR)Harrison's mother Louise contributed the line: \"What they need is a damn good whacking.\"","please_please_me":"This was The Beatles first single released in America, and getting it issued in the States was a struggle. The Beatles first recorded \"Please Please Me\" on September 11, 1962. That version was rejected for release. They re-recorded the song on November 26, 1962 and that version was first issued in England on the EMI-owned Parlophone label on January 12, 1963. After EMI's US affiliate, Capitol Records, rejected the song (and a lot of other early Beatles material), the small, Chicago-based Vee Jay label stepped in and released \"Please Please Me\" stateside on February 25, 1963 and again on January 30, 1964 and August 10,1964. The only release that charted was the second, when The Beatles finally made a name for themselves in America. (thanks to music historian Gary Theroux)John Lennon, who was a big Roy Orbison fan, wrote this in the style of Orbison's overly-dramatic singing. Beatles producer George Martin suggested it would sound better sped up. In 2006, Martin told The Observer Music Monthly, \"The songs the Beatles first gave me were crap. This was 1962 and they played a dreadful version of 'Please Please Me' as a Roy Orbison-style ballad. But I signed them because they made me feel good to be with them, and if they could convey that on a stage then everyone in the audience would feel good, too. So I took 'Love Me Do' and added some harmonica, but it wasn't financially rewarding even though Brian Epstein bought about 2,000 copies. Then we worked for ages on their new version of 'Please Please Me,' and I said: 'Gentlemen, you're going to have your first #1.'\"This was rumored to be about oral sex. The Beatles denied this, since they had a very clean image to maintain at the time. Lennon said of the song: \"I was always intrigued by the double use of the word 'please.'\"Although in the UK this was officially a #2 record, three of the four charts used at the time - Melody Maker, NME and Disc - listed it #1. Only the Record Retailer chart had it at #2.The group's name was misspelled \"Beattles\" on the record label on the first American release.Typical for the verse in \"Please Please Me,\" and for many of Lennon's songs, are the long notes (legato) that are also used in hymns - even sounding a bit like Mendelssohn's Wedding March in A Midsummer Night's Dream. When Lennon was a little boy he used to go to church on Sunday. Afterwards he improvised his own counterpoints to the hymns.The climbing in the melody \"Come on, come on...\" is similar to parts of two traditional folk songs: \"New's Evens Song\" and \"Come Fair One.\" (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm, for above 2)In the UK, this was re-released in 1983 to coincide with the 20th anniversary of it's initial release.The Beatles performed this on their second Ed Sullivan Show appearance in 1964. Sullivan was not a fan of many rock groups, but loved The Beatles and had them on his show whenever he could.This was the second Beatles single released in England, the first being \"Love Me Do.\"An early version of this song with session drummer Andy White playing drums instead of Ringo can be found on Anthology 1.The Please Please Me album was The Beatles debut long player. When they recorded it at Abbey Studios in London, John Lennon was struggling with a streaming cold and all were tired after a tour supporting Helen Shapiro. However with the help and encouragement of producer George Martin within nine hours and 45 minutes they had recorded their groundbreaking LP.The album was released to cash in on the success of this single in the UK. It took them about 12 hours to record, and was basically a re-creation of their live show, which was mostly cover songs. The album was released with the text \"Please Please Me with Love Me Do and 12 other songs.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2)The Beatles performed this on Thank Your Lucky Stars on January 19, 1963. It was their first ever UK television appearance.The British Prime Minister Gordon Brown revealed in an interview on the British TV program GMTV that this was the first record that he ever bought.George Martin told Music Week magazine that the first time the Beatles played this to him, he wasn't very impressed. He recalled: \"I listened to it and I said: 'Do you know that's too bloody boring for words? It's a dirge. At twice the speed it might sound reasonable.' They took me at my word. I was joking and they came back and played it to me sped up and put a harmonica on it, and it became their first big hit.\"John Lennon was partly inspired by a line from a Bing Crosby song that read, \"Please lend a little ear to my pleas.\" He recalled: \"I remember the day I wrote it, I heard Roy Orbison doing \"Only The Lonely\", or something. And I was also always intrigued by the words to a Bing Crosby song that went, 'Please lend a little ear to my pleas'. The double use of the word 'please'. So it was a combination of Roy Orbison and Bing Crosby.\"Lennon was a great fan of Bing Crosby and when in 1978, Yoko gave him a vintage '50s Wurlitzer jukebox for his birthday he loaded the machine with as many 78-rpm records by the easy-listening vocalist as he could find.This is Keith Richards' favorite Beatles song. He told Jimmy Fallon: \"I've always told McCartney, 'Please Please Me.' I just love the chimes, and I was there at the time and it was beautiful. Mind you, there's plenty of others, but if I've got to pick one, 'Please Please Me'… oh, yeah!\"Lennon-McCartney was the standard alphabetical credit for their Beatles songwriters compositions except on Please Please Me, where for reasons unknown, the names were reversed.","polythene_pam":"Polythene is a British term for Polyethylene, a plastic polymer used in containers, insulation, and packaging. Written by John Lennon, this song has a rather strange background, and fortunately our Beatles expert Pattie Noah has sorted it out. Writes Pattie: \"On 'Polythene Pam,' John based her on two people. One was Patricia Hodgett, who was a Cavern Dweller (someone who hung out at the Cavern Club, where The Beatles used to play). Pat used to actually eat polythene! They started calling her 'Polythene Pat.' Not a far stretch to Pam. The other woman was named Stephanie, and she was the girlfriend of John's good friend, the poet Royston Ellis. John was with Ellis and Stephanie in the Channel Islands and they all had a three-way sexual experience with her wearing an outfit made from polythene. I think they were even doing it on a bed covered in sheets of polythene. Ellis said, 'We'd read all these things about leather and we didn't have any leather but I had my oilskins and we had some polythene bags from somewhere. We all dressed up in them and wore them to bed.' Ellis says nothing 'perverted' really happened... but John did ;).\"Lennon sang this in a thick Liverpool accent. Like the other Beatles, his regular singing voice sounded very American because he grew up listening to US artists.In the line, \"She's the kind of a girl that makes the News Of The World,\" The News Of The World is a tabloid newspaper that specializes in risqué news reporting. Pam must have been a wild girl. (thanks, Tim - Phoenix, AZ)The Beatles recorded this as one song with \"She Came In Through the Bathroom Window.\"Originally intended for The White Album, this was used in a suite of songs at the end of Abbey Road.","rain":"John Lennon wrote most of \"Rain.\" It was his first song to get really deep, exploring themes of reality and illusion - after all, rain or shine is just a state of mind.This was the first song to use a tape played backwards, which created the strange audio effect. John Lennon discovered the technique when he put the tape for \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" on the wrong way. He was stoned at the time, and producer George Martin had to convince him that using a backward recording for the entire song was a bad idea. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Ringo Starr has said this is his best drumming on a Beatles song.The backwards vocal at the end fade out is actually the songs first line: \"When the rain comes they run and hide their heads\". (thanks, Chet - Saratoga Springs, NY)This was one of the first Beatles records to feature loud, booming bass. McCartney's bassline is extremely recognizable, in contrast to The Beatles' older records. (thanks, Chris LaBenne - Niles, OH)This was released as the B-side of \"Paperback Writer.\" It was recorded during the Revolver sessions.As part of the studio manipulation that gave this song such an unusual sound, the rhythm track was played fast and then slowed down on tape.The Beatles shot a video for this song with director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who was tapped because he worked on the UK music show Ready, Steady,Go!. The videos for \"Rain\" and \"Paperback Writer\" were shot at the same time, with some footage recorded at Abbey Road studios, but most of it outdoors at the Chiswick House gardens in London.These videos were done so The Beatles could promote the single without actually performing on the various TV shows that drew huge audiences and drove sales. In doing so, they set a standard for music videos, as other bands followed suit. The \"Rain\" video uses many elements that would become commonplace, including candid shots from between takes.","real_love":"This was an unfinished song written by John Lennon that was completed by the remaining Beatles. It was the second \"new\" release for the Anthology 2 album (\"Free As A Bird\" was the first). Yoko Ono supplied Lennon's demos and gave the remaining Beatles permission to use them.Jeff Lynne from The Electric Light Orchestra put this together. He has produced albums for George Harrison and played with him in The Traveling Wilburys.Lennon recorded his demo on a small tape recorder, which posed a challenge when Lynne tried to mix it with updated tracks. He was able to use a noise reduction system to improve the sound. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Paul McCartney did his best John Lennon imitation to help the lead vocal because the recording of John's voice was low and spotty in some places. The lead vocal is actually a John and Paul duet. (thanks, Glen - Dallas, TX)This is the only Beatles song where the songwriting credit is John Lennon alone instead of Lennon-McCartney or all four Beatles. (thanks, Glen - Dallas, TX)According to notes in the John Lennon album Acoustic, when Lennon wrote this song, the original title was \"Girls and Boys.\" (thanks, Julia - OH)","revolution":"This was the first overtly political Beatles song. It was John Lennon's response to the Vietnam War.John Lennon wrote this in India while The Beatles were at a transcendental meditation camp with The Maharishi. Lennon told Rolling Stone: \"I had been thinking about it up in the hills in India. I still had this 'God will save us' feeling about it, that it's going to be all right (even now I'm saying 'Hold on, John, it's going to be all right,' otherwise, I won't hold on) but that's why I did it, I wanted to talk, I wanted to say my piece about revolution. I wanted to tell you, or whoever listens, to communicate, to say 'What do you say? This is what I say.'\"Revolutionaries take different approaches to reach their goals. In a 1998 interview with Uncut, Yoko One gave her thoughts on Lennon's approach and how he expressed it in this song: \"John's idea of revolution was that he did not want to create the situation where when you destroy statues, you become a statue. And also what he means is that there's too much repercussion in the usual form of revolution. He preferred evolution. So you have to take a peaceful method to get peace rather than you don't care what method you take to get peace, and he was very, very adamant about that.\"The original slow version appears on The White Album. The fast, loud version was released as a single. In the slow version, Lennon says \"count me in\" as well as \"count me out\" when referring to violence. This gives the song a dual meaning.This was released as the B-side of \"Hey Jude.\" Lennon wanted it to be the first A-side released on Apple Records, the label The Beatles started, but \"Hey Jude\" got the honor.There are so many versions of this song because Paul McCartney didn't like it. Lennon really wanted this song to be the 'A' side of the single instead of \"Hey Jude,\" and kept changing it around to come up with something that would make Paul see it his way. He basically wrote the song because he felt like he was being pulled in so many directions by different people, all of whom wanted his backing, politically. It was also him questioning his own belief in the revolution that was going on... whether he was \"out\" or \"in.\" In truth, he was writing about a revolution of the mind rather than a physical \"in the streets\" revolution. He truly believed that revolution comes from inner change rather than social violence. (This is discussed in the DVD Composing the Beatles Songbook)Nike used this for commercials in 1987. Capitol Records, who owns the performance rights, meaning The Beatles version of the song, was paid $250,000. Michael Jackson, who owns the publishing rights, meaning use of the words and music, also had to agree and was paid for the song.The Nike commercials caused a huge backlash from Beatles fans who felt that Nike was disrespecting the legacy of John Lennon, who probably would have objected to its use. There were plans to use more Beatles songs in future ads, but they were abandoned when it became clear it was not good business practice. As years went by, it became more acceptable to use songs in commercials, but Beatles songs were still considered sacred, especially since the group did not control their rights. In 2002, \"When I'm 64\" was used in a commercial for Allstate insurance. Many Beatles fans were not pleased, but it didn't get nearly the reaction of the Nike commercials, partly because it was not a political song, but also because it was sung by Julian Lennon, which implied endorsement by his father.On September 4, 1968, The Beatles made a promotional film for this song and \"Hey Jude\" at Twickenham Studios in London. These were directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who did the previous Beatles videos: \"Paperback Writer\" and \"Rain.\"Unlike those clips, which were shot outdoors, the \"Hey Jude\" and \"Revolution\" videos were shot in a studio setting and meant to look like the band was performing it live. They both aired September 8 on Frost On Sunday, a popular UK show hosted by David Frost, who was at the Twickenham shoot to introduce the clip for the segment on his show, making it appear that the band was really there.Another edit of the footage was later broadcast on Top Of The Pops, and yet another was shown in America on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. When the Beatles compilation 1+ was released in 2015, a restored version of the video was included in the set.Nicky Hopkins played the piano. When The Beatles needed keyboards, they usually used Hopkins, Billy Preston, or their producer, George Martin.The dirty guitar sound was created by plugging the guitars directly into the audio board. The guitar sounded so scratchy that many who bought the 45 RPM single tried to return it, thinking it was defective. (thanks to Dwight Rounds, author of The Year The Music Died, 1964-1972)The word \"Revolution\" is mentioned just once, in the first line.John Lennon wanted his vocals to have an unusual sound, so he recorded most of them lying on his back in the studio. The famous scream at the beginning is a double-tracked recording of Lennon. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France and Jonathon - Clermont, FL)The version on the Hey Jude compilation, released in February 1970 in the US, was the B-side of the \"Hey Jude\" single. The Hey Jude compilation album peaked at #2 in the US and consists of a collection of singles and B-sides that had not previously appeared on US non-soundtrack album releases. The album cover was taken at the final Beatles photo session, at Lennon's (later Starr's) country estate in Ascot, England. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Thompson Twins performed this song at the Philadelphia stage of Live Aid on July 13, 1985. The concert, which raised money for famine relief in Africa, had a global audience of at least 1.5 billion. Thompson Twins were joined on stage for the performance by Madonna (who contributed backing vocals and tambourine), Steve Stevens (best known as Billy Idol's guitarist) and Nile Rodgers, who was also on guitar.Thompson Twins included the song on their album Here's to Future Days, which was released a few months later and produced by Rodgers.The Stone Temple Pilots performed this at Madison Square Garden as part of the 2001 special, Come Together: A Night For John Lennon's Words And Music. Their version was released as a single, with proceeds going to charity.","revolution_9":"John Lennon wrote this with contributions from Yoko Ono. It's a highly experimental piece, which Lennon once called \"The music of the future.\" It is the most controversial and bizarre track on the album - you have to have a very open mind to appreciate it.This was made by layering tape loops over the basic rhythm of \"Revolution.\" Lennon was trying to create an atmosphere of a revolution in progress. The tape loops came from EMI archives, and the \"Number 9\" voice heard over and over is an engineer testing equipment.Lennon told Rolling Stone that this was, \"an unconscious picture of what I actually think will happen when it happens; that was just like a drawing of revolution.\" He added: \"All the thing was made with loops, I had about thirty loops going, fed them onto one basic track. I was getting classical tapes, going upstairs and chopping them up, making it backwards and things like that, to get the sound effects. One thing was an engineer's testing tape and it would come on with a voice saying 'This is EMI Test Series #9.' I just cut up whatever he said and I'd number nine it. Nine turned out to be my birthday and my lucky number and everything. I didn't realize it; it was just so funny the voice saying 'Number nine'; it was like a joke, bringing number nine into it all the time, that's all it was.\"Paul McCartney and Beatles producer George Martin hated this and tried to keep it off the album.This is the longest Beatles song - it runs 8:15. It also took longer to complete than any other track on album.This helped fuel the \"Paul is dead\" rumors. If played backwards, you were supposed to hear the car crash where Paul died, and a voice saying \"Turn me on, dead man.\" Also, playing the line, \"I'm not in the mood for wearing clothing\" in reverse eventually becomes a rather odd but clear reversal, \"There were two, there are none now.\" This is referencing the rumor that Paul McCartney died in a car with \"Lovely Rita\" and that the 2 were burned away after the wreck.The rumor took off in October, 1969 when a listener called the radio station WKNR in Detroit and told the DJ Russ Gibb about the backward message. When Gibb played it backwards on his show, listeners went wild and spent the next week calling in and offering their own rumors. The story quickly spread, and McCartney helped it along by laying low and letting it play out.Lennon felt the number 9 was quite significant. He was happy that, after he changed his name to John Ono Lennon, his and Yoko's names collectively contained 9 O's. (thanks, Nicole - Lake Forest, CA)According to the book The Beatles, Lennon And Me, by John Lennon's childhood friend Pete Shotton, One evening, Lennon was with Shotton in the attic of his Kenwood home, tripping on LSD and smoking a few joints. They messed about with John's Brunnel recorders, fiddling with feedback, running recordings backwards and creating tape loops. Opening the windows for some fresh air, John and Pete began to shout whatever was on their minds at the trees outside, the recorder running. This night's lark was to later captured on \"Revolution 9.\" (thanks, Margaret - Cullman, AL)Marilyn Manson released their own version of this on the B-side of the single for \"Get Your Gunn.\" It was called \"Revelation 9\" and ran 12:57. (thanks, Brett - Edmonton, Canada)This was parodied on an episode of The Simpsons. When the guys for a group called The B-Sharps, Barney meets a girl during recording. He exclaims at the studio that he's making the music of all time. The song is Barney's girl friend (with striking resemblance to Yoko Ono) saying \"Number 8\" and Barney burping. (thanks, yo - sudbury, Ontario, Canada)Charles Manson thought that when they screamed the words \"Right!\" it was actually \"Rise!\" meaning the black community rising over the white people. Charles Manson was of course crazy, and thought The Beatles were warning about a race war. (thanks, Mischa - Winnipeg, Australia)","rocky_raccoon":"Paul McCartney got the idea for this when he was playing guitar with John Lennon and Donovan Leitch at the Maharishi's camp in India. The Beatles went there in 1968 to study transcendental meditation.Beatles producer George Martin played the piano in an old-west saloon style. Several Beatles songs feature piano parts, which were usually played by either Martin, Lennon, Nicky Hopkins or Billy Preston.The main character was originally called Rocky Sassoon but McCartney changed it to Raccoon, as he thought the name was more cowboyish.Like many of McCartney's songs at the time, this was a pastiche, in this instance of folk songs. He explained in Mojo magazine October 2008: \"I've got to admit a lot of my stuff is pastiche. I'd learned by then that pastiche would work because inevitably behind it would be something more.\"McCartney told Mojo about the song: \"Rocky was me writing (speaks-sings in a baccy-chewing old prospector voice), 'It was way back in the hills of Dakota-or Arkansas-in the mining days. And it was tough, picking shovels, and we were underground 24 hours a day…' I could have taken this serious route, researched it- Take This Hammer (a prison work song recorded by British skiffle star Lonnie Donegan in 1959), stuff I'd been brought up on. But at that point I was a little tongue-in cheek. So I crossed it with a (British singer and banjo player popular in the 1940s) George Formby sensibility, where John and I would go (sings a bit of doggerel in a choppy rhythm)- Stanley Holloway, Albert in The Lion's Den (the comic poem The Lion and Albert, written by Holloway's creative partner Marriott Edgar in 1932). We were very versed in all that stuff (sings opening lines of Rocky Raccoon in the same choppy way). The scanning of the poetical stanza always interested me. Somehow this little story unfolded itself. I was basically spoofing 'the folk-singer.' And it included Gideon's Bible, which I've seen in every hotel I've ever been in. You open the drawer and there it is! Who's this guy Gideon! I still don't know to this day who the heck he is. I'm sure he's a very well-meaning guy. Rocky Raccoon was a freewheeling thing, the fun of mixing a folky ramble with Albert In The Lion's Den with its ''orse's 'ead 'andle,' ha ha.\" ","run_for_your_life":"John Lennon was inspired by an Elvis Presley song, \"Baby, Let's Play House,\" when he wrote this. The title and entire first line came from Elvis' song: \"I'd rather see you dead little girl, than to be with another man.\"\"Baby, Let's Play House\" was written in 1955 by Richard Gunther and was based on a 1951 Country \u0026 Western song by Eddy Arnold titled \"I Want To Play House With You,\" written by Cy Coben. That song contains the lyric, \"I'd rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man.\"We'd all rather forget this song, an otherwise sour note on the monumental Rubber Soul album, but here it is, so we have to look at it anyway. John Lennon made no bones about this being his \"least favorite Beatles song.\" Just about everybody agrees. Do keep in mind that this was 1965; there was more slack attitudes towards gender equality than there are now.There are a couple of other songs by Lennon with misogynist undertones, including \"I'll Cry Instead\" and \"You Can't Do That.\" Paul McCartney, in interviews for the book Many Years From Now, explains that while he had girlfriends and open relationships, Lennon had a marriage and hence a wife to worry about while he was on the road touring all the time. Interestingly enough, Yoko Ono mellowed him out and Lennon and Ono became crusading activists for all kinds of civil rights causes.On December 18, 1992, the Canadian radio station CFRA banned this song because they felt the line, \"I'd reather see you dead little girl, than to be with another man,\" promoted violence against women.","savoy_truffle":"This was inspired by Eric Clapton's love of chocolate. He and George Harrison were good friends.George Harrison got the lyrics for this from the inside lid of a box of chocolates. Montelimart, Ginger Sling, Cream Tangerine, and Coffee Dessert were names of candies in the Mackintosh \"Good News\" assortment.Beatles' publicist Derek Taylor wrote some of the words.Harrison had the sax distorted to create a distinctive sound.According to Mojo magazine, the line \"You know that what you eat you are\" was suggested to Harrison by the Beatles' press officer Derek Taylor.","sexy_sadie":"John Lennon wrote this about the Maharishi while he was leaving India in 1968. After attending his Transcendental Meditation camp with the other Beatles, Lennon thought The Maharishi was a crock.The song describes Lennon's total dissatisfaction with the Maharishi. While at his retreat, it has been said that the Maharishi attempted to rape Mia Farrow. Once The Beatles learned of this, they immediately went to the Maharishi, and Lennon announced they were all leaving. The Maharishi asked why? Lennon said, \"If you're so cosmic, you'll know why.\" As originally written, some of its lyrics were considered obscene, and had to be refined. Lennon had used the Maharishi's name, but had to change it for fear of being sued. But, Sexy Sadie is the Maharishi. Needless to say, that was the end of the Maharishi and The Beatles relationship. (thanks, Dominic - Pittsburgh, PA)Lennon dubbed the Maharishi \"sexy\" after he hit on Mia Farrow. Farrow's sister, Prudence, was also there, and her experience led Lennon to write \"Dear Prudence.\"Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was born January 12, 1917. The founder of the Transcendental Meditation Movement, the Beatles spent time with the Maharishi in 1967-68; they were visiting him when they learned of the death of their manager Brian Epstein. John was disenchanted with the Maharishi and thought he was a hoax, and left abruptly convincing the others he was using the girls The Beatles had brought him.This song required 52 takes and a full day-and-a-half of studio time. Lennon spent much of time cussing his way through the sessions, deeply hurt after coming to the conclusion that the Maharishi was not as holy as he'd hoped.The song confirmed Charles Manson's belief that the Beatles were talking directly to him, by virtue of one of his followers, Susan Atkins, having already been nicknamed Sadie Mae Glutz. Many of the tracks from The White Album (\"Piggies\" for example) were interpreted by Manson as messages directed to him.In the Anthology book when The Beatles were talking about Manson, John Lennon was quoted as saying, \"All the other fellows had some 'influence' on Manson, but not me I didn't do nothing,\" but Sadie was the nickname for Susan Atkins (Sadie Mae Glutz) which did contribute to Manson's belief that the Beatles were singing about him and his \"Family.\" (thanks, Breanna - Henderson, NV)","sgt_peppers_lonely_hearts_club_band":"After recording this song, Paul McCartney had the idea of doing the whole album as if Sgt. Pepper was a real band. It became the title track of what was considered a \"Concept\" album, with the songs running seamlessly together on the record.The album was heavily produced and took 129 days and about 700 hours to complete. The Beatles first album, Please Please Me, was recorded in less than 10 hours.The crowd noise was dubbed in. The Beatles had stopped touring by then.Three days after the album came out, Jimi Hendrix opened a concert with this. McCartney and Harrison were both there, and were very impressed that Hendrix learned it so quickly.See the Sgt. Pepper's album cover in Song Images.Paul McCartney wrote this and sang lead.This is reprised at the end of the album before the final track, \"A Day In The Life.\"This was recorded as one song with \"With A Little Help From My Friends.\" They flow seamlessly on the album, creating a problem for radio stations that want to play just one of the songs. (thanks, Don - Rapid City, SD)George Harrison, Paul McCartney, and Ringo Starr played this on May 19, 1979 at Eric Clapton's wedding. Clapton married Harrison's ex-wife, Pattie.Artist Peter Blake designed the album cover as if Sgt. Pepper's band had just performed a concert. He asked The Beatles who they wanted at the concert, and put them in the cover design.All living people depicted on the cover were asked permission. Mae West refused at first - she didn't want to be part of a \"Lonely Hearts Club Band\" - but The Beatles wrote her a letter and she agreed. Other characters depicted on the album cover include comedic duos Laurel \u0026 Hardy and Abbott \u0026 Costello, Marilyn Monroe, Shirley Temple and W.C. Field. (thanks, Patrick - Tallapoosa, GA)Lennon wanted Jesus, Gandhi, and Hitler on the cover. He had recently taken a lot of heat for saying The Beatles were \"Bigger than Jesus,\" so they decided not to.It was rumored that the hand that is sticking out above Paul is that of Adolph Hitler. A Hitler cut out was on the set, but if you look at some side shots of the photo session, you can clearly see that the hand belongs to comic Issy Bonn, whose face is seen in between Paul McCartney and George Harrison. (thanks, Andre - Tampa, FL)On the cover of this album McCartney is taller than the other Beatles. This added to rumors of his death, since there is also a hand above Paul's head which is an omen of death. Also, if you take a mirror and put the edge on the center of the Lonely Hearts Club Band drum an arrow will point directly to McCartney.Sgt. Pepper was the first pop album to come with printed lyrics on the cover.The title is a parody of American bands who were choosing ridiculously long names for their groups.Twelve years after \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" appeared on the Sgt. Pepper album, they were released together as a two-song medley and reached US #71 and UK #63. (thanks, Jerro - New Alexandria, PA)In 2005, Bob Geldof helped organize Live 8, a set of concerts held in 8 countries with the goal of promoting activism. The concerts coincided with the G-8 summit, and Geldof was hoping to send a message to world leaders that they should increase aid to Africa and institute fair trade practices. On the London stage, U2 played this with McCartney to kick off the concert. The opening line, \"It was 20 years ago today,\" was a reference to Live Aid, which Geldof organized for famine relief in 1985.Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was the first rock album to win a Grammy for Album of the Year. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)On the album cover, Paul McCartney is wearing an Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) badge on his right sleeve. You can see this better on the inside artwork. (thanks, Pat - Varna, Canada)The hand-painted drum skin used on the cover of the Sgt Pepper album was sold at Christie's House in London on 10th July 2008 for £541,250 ($1,071,000) - setting a record for non-lyrics Beatles memorabilia.","sgt_peppers_lonely_hearts_club_band_reprise":"This is an upbeat reprise of the first song and title track of the album. A \"concept album,\" it was produced as if Sgt. Pepper's was a real band.This song was produced in a rush when The Beatles decided to bring back the theme song to introduce the last track on the album, \"A Day In The Life.\" The idea to reprise the song came from Neil Aspinall, The Beatles' friend and road manager.The audience sounds were dubbed in to make it sound live. John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison shared lead vocals.","she_came_in_through_the_bathroom_window":"Paul McCartney wrote this about a fan who broke into his house. Diane Ashley claims it was her. \"We found a ladder in his garden and stuck it up the bathroom window which he'd left slightly open,\" she said. \"I was the one who climbed up and got in.\"Now married with four children, Diane keeps a framed photo of herself with Paul on her kitchen shelf and looks back on her days as an Apple Scruff with affection: \"I don't regret any of it. I had a great time, a really great time.\"Landis Kearnon (known at the time as Susie Landis) gave us the following account:Here, all this time I thought this song was written about me and my friend Judy. What a surprise to learn there was someone named Diane Ashley who put a ladder up to Paul's house and climbed in through the bathroom window. This and the bit about \"quit the police department\" being inspired by an ex-cop taxi driver in NYC tells me something I already know about songwriting, which is that many songs are composites. This one obviously was because Diane wasn't the only person having a profound effect on Paul McCartney by crawling in a bathroom window in 1967 (maybe '68 in her case). Judy and I were paid $1500 by Greene \u0026 Stone, a couple of sleazy artist managers driving around the Sunset Strip in a Chinchilla-lined caddy limo, to \"borrow\" the quarter-inch master of \"A Day In The Life\" off of David Crosby's reel-to-reel, drive it to Sunset Sound studios in Hollywood where Greene \u0026 Stone duped it, then put it back where we found it at Crosby's Beverly Glen Canyon pad. Crosby was playing with the Byrds that day in Venice so we knew his house was empty. This was the day after a major rainstorm so the back of his house was one big mudslide. We climbed up it, leaving 8-inch deep footprints and, you guessed it, gained access via the bathroom window, leaving behind footprints and a veritable goldmine of forensic matter. We were really nervous and did not make clear mental notes of how the master reel was on the player, but did have the sense to leave Crosby's front door unlocked while we drove across town and back. After the tape was back on the machine (badly) we changed out of our muddy shoes, drove to the Cheetah in Venice, and hung out with the Byrds into the evening, thinking we were awfully clever and cute. We did not know why Greene \u0026 Stone would pay so much money for a copy of a Beatles song, other than the fact that is was a groundbreaking and mind-blowing piece, but found out the next day when we heard \"A Day In The Life\" on KHJ, I think it was. Greene \u0026 Stone had used it as payola to get one of their groups, The Cake, singing \"Yes We Have No Bananas,\" on the air. Which they did, and it sucked, but oh well. By the following day \"A Day In The Life\" was no longer on the air. And just a day or two after that there was a front page blurb in the LA Times about \"A Day In The Life\" getting aired one month prior to the release date of the single and the Sgt. Pepper LP, which apparently cost the Beatles plenty and they were suing Capitol or Columbia, whichever the label was, for $2 million... and McCartney was flying in from London to deal with the mess. Oops. Judy and I nearly sank through the floor. Though we were active \"dancers\" in the various nightclubs on the Sunset Strip, we lay low for a while, not knowing what to expect. In fact, other than a song being written and a GREAT cover by Joe Cocker, nothing happened. We got our money, spent it on groovy clothes, of course (what else was there?) and never heard a word about it.\"I knew what I could not say\" and \"protected by a silver spoon\" seemed to explain why there were no repercussions. My dad was a TV director who had already threatened to bust and ruin David Crosby for smoking pot with and deflowering his daughter; he had clout and David was afraid of him. Judy was from money and influence too. I feel that David knew exactly who had broken in and borrowed the tape but couldn't press charges. He probably wasn't supposed to be playing the master for all his friends and hangers-on, so there must have been hell to pay for him. I always felt bad for the cred it must have cost him with his friend Paul McCartney.Oh, the bit about \"Sunday's on the phone to Monday, Tuesday's on the phone to me\" - that was somebody named Sunday, maybe a detective, I can't remember now, calling the producer Billy Monday about the break-in and song leak. Billy Monday, knowing she was a friend of McCartney's, called Tuesday Weld, and it was she who called Paul in London and told him the news. Well, I guess I didn't make this very short after all. But you can't tell me that this incident didn't feed into the overall inspiration for the song. I'm just glad it turned out so cool and hope it made a heap for them in compensation for the publicity costs at the outset.It was interesting and exciting then, that's for sure. Even though I came of age into that scene and had nothing to compare it to, I still had a sense at the time of being at the epicenter of something big. Some of that was attributable to the hubris of youth, but some of it turned out to be real, as it happened. Now, present time, it makes my day to come across someone who still finds it interesting or even knows what or whom I'm talking about. By the way, I never did get to meet the Beatles, though I was invited to party where they were staying once, when I was 17. My mother wouldn't let me go! I never forgave her.I lived in LA until 1987 where I was a model, actress, (groupie, but that wasn't professional), marching band manager, religious (Buddhist) leader, newspaper columnist, secretary, copywriter, copy editor, account executive, screenwriter, songwriter, band leader, session singer, textile designer, artist. Since then, in the Santa Fe area and now, since 1992, in Tucson, I continued my artistic and musical endeavors, ran a fabric-painting factory, was a jazz singer for several years (which has mutated to something more individual and artistic of late), have worked numerous odd jobs from pizza delivery to bookstore management, and am now close to completing my first novel, which is set in a Buddhist cult in the early '70s.In the '70s I traveled halfway around the world on a square-rigged cargo ship, lived and sang in Europe for three years, and, as of 1991, am a mother of one though I never married.Subsequent to the bathroom window event, my friend and partner in crime, as it were, Judy, went off with a Dick Clark Productions road show (can't remember the name of it but it was something timely) as \"Irma the Dancing Girl.\" Her job, nightly, in each new town, was to put on a bikini, dance, and paint wild, acid abstract canvases with her extremely long blond hair. I, on the other hand, joined a Buddhist cult, which was like living on another planet entirely, and completely disappeared from view, as far as the \"scene\" was concerned. Judy and I didn't hang out much after we realized the impact of our little romp. We didn't talk about it, but we may have decided at some level that we pushed our combined wildness a bit too far on that one and moved on to \"safer\" friends. I saw her once in the early '70s. She had been married and divorced, was the mother of one, and that was the last contact we had.The Beatles recorded this as one song with \"Polythene Pam.\"The Beatles gave this to Joe Cocker, who released it in 1969. The Beatles released their version first. Cocker's version was used on the soundtrack to the movie All This and World War II, released in 1976. A strange mix of World War II documentary footage set to the music of the Beatles, the movie bombed and has barely been heard of since. Others who covered The Beatles on the soundtrack include Peter Gabriel, Elton John, Tina Turner, Leo Sayer, Frankie Laine and the Bee Gees. (thanks, Emma - Palm Beach, Australia)This is part of a suite of songs at the end of Abbey Road. They used bits from many songs they never finished to put the suite together.McCartney played lead guitar and Harrison played bass. It was usually the other way around.McCartney said in a documentary shown February 6, 2002 in England that part of the lyric was inspired by sitting in the back of a New York cab. The drivers name was on display (Quitts) saying \"Ex Police Department,\" which inspired the line: \"And so I quit the Police Department and got myself a steady job...\" (thanks, John - London, England)","she_loves_you":"The Beatles tell quite a tale in this tidy Pop song. Some poor guy thinks he has lost his girl for good, but he's redeemed when he finds out from a friend that she still loves him. There's even a moral at the end of the story: \"Pride can hurt you too.\" Good advice when arguing with a loved one.This was an instant hit in the England, but not in America where it was released on Swan records, the only US label that would take it. Swan put it out in September 1963, but while The Beatles were huge in England, they were still no big deal in America until February 1964. That's when Beatlemania took hold and this became a US hit.This popularized the phrase \"yeah, yeah, yeah.\" Paul McCartney's dad wanted them to sing \"yes, yes, yes\" instead because he thought it sounded more dignified.This was one of 4 Beatles songs that was never released in stereo. The others are \"Love Me Do,\" \"I'll Get You\" and \"You Know My Name (Look Up The Number).\" (thanks, don - rapid city, SD)The Beatles released a German version translated as \"Sie Liebt Dich\" in the US in 1964. They learned some German when they became the house band in Hamburg in 1962, but needed a German speaker to help them with the lyrics. They recorded the German version in Paris - it was the only time they recorded outside of England.Apart from \"My Bonnie,\" which was recorded with Tony Sheridan in their early days in Hamburg, the only other song the Beatles recorded in another language, again German, was \"I Want To Hold Your Hand.\" \"Komm Gib Mir Deine Hand\" was recorded the same time as \"Sie Liebt Dich.\"\"Sie Liebt Dich\" peaked at #97, the lowest position of the Beatles' 71 Hot 100 charted songs.In the UK, this is the biggest-selling Beatles single. It was the held the record for top-selling UK single of all time until 1977, when Wings (led by McCartney) topped it with \"Mull Of Kintyre.\"Jack Paar played a video clip of this on his show on January 3, 1964. The Beatles had appeared on news clips as part of stories about their success in England, but this was the first time they appeared on a US TV talk show. They also played it on both of their live Ed Sullivan Show appearances. When The Beatles agreed to do the show, they were not a big deal in America and took less money than most acts received for their fee. When The Beatles played The Ed Sullivan Show for the first time, it got the largest audience ever for a TV show. Sullivan began having regular musical guests from the world of popular music, and it became a showcase for groups like The Rolling Stones, The Supremes, Santana and Creedence Clearwater Revival.McCartney and Lennon were inspired to write this after a concert at the Majestic Ballroom in Newcastle when they were part of a tour with Roy Orbison and Gerry \u0026 the Pacemakers. Says McCartney, \"There was a Bobby Rydell song out at the time \"Forget Him\" and, as often happens, you think of one song when you write another. We were in a van up in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. I'd planned an answering song where a couple of us would sing 'She loves you' and the other ones would answer 'Yeah Yeah.' We decided that was a crummy idea but at least we then had the idea of a song called She Loves You. So we sat in the hotel bedroom for a few hours and wrote it; John and I, sitting on twin beds with guitars.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)In England, this hit #1 twice in 1963, first on September 4 and again on November 20.The single of this was the first record Ozzy Osbourne ever bought. The Beatles were a big influence on him because they were also poor kids from a small town in England.This was one of the Beatles songs that held the top 5 positions on the US chart on April 4, 1964. Others were: \"Twist and Shout,\" \"Can't Buy Me Love,\" \"I Want To Hold Your Hand\" and \"Please, Please Me.\"The Beatles played part of this at the end of \"All You Need Is Love,\" which they recorded 4 years later.This song was played at the conclusion of the concert sequence at the end of the film A Hard Day's Night, although it wasn't included on the soundtrack album. (thanks, Charlie - Cape Girardeau, MO)Norman Smith, who was The Beatles engineer, told the story in his autobiography John Called me Normal about feeling his heart sink when he spotted the lyrics on the music stand. As he later relayed to Mark Lewinsohn: \"She loves you, yeah yeah yeah, She loves you, yeah yeah yeah, she loves you yeah yeah yeah yeah... I thought, My God, what a lyric! This is going to be the one I do not like.\"Smith had a hit in 1972 with \"Oh Babe What Would You Say\" as Hurricane Smith. He also produced the first three Pink Floyd albums.There is a very clear edit in this song between the lines \"I think it's only fair/Pride can hurt you too.\" It appears that two version had been edited together. (thanks, Rick - Mount Ephraim, NJ, for above 2)In August 2009 the Official Chart Company compiled a list of the Beatles biggest selling hits in the UK, including re-issues. They revealed that this song was the Fab Four's best seller in their native country, followed by \"I Want To Hold Your Hand\" and \"Can't Buy Me Love.\"Regarding the falsetto exaltation that occurs at the song's manic peak, McCartney once explained: \"The 'wooooo' was taken from the Isley Brothers' 'Twist and Shout.' We stuck it in everything.\"The Melissa Manchester hit You Should Hear How She Talks About You was written as a contemporary take on this song, with the singer telling a friend that a guy is really into her.","she_said_she_said":"The song was inspired by actor Peter Fonda, who was dropping acid with John Lennon while they were together at a party at the Playboy Mansion. John was trying to take in the beauty of the girls and the atmosphere, and Peter Fonda was whispering, \"I know what it's like to be dead man.\" John originally wrote it as \"He Said He Said\" because it did come from Peter, but felt it didn't sound right, so he changed it to \"She.\" (thanks, Saint - New Orleans, LA)Fonda accidentally shot himself and almost died when he was 10. That is what he was talking about when he said he knew what it was like to be dead.Fonda has said that Lennon always hated him. He feels Lennon didn't like intellectual types around him.The Beatles recorded this in 9 hours during the last session for Revolver.","shes_a_woman":"It was a big deal for John Lennon and Paul McCartney to use the phrase \"Turn Me On\" in the lyrics. It was a drug reference. Years later, they would use the line \"I'd love to turn you on\" in \"A Day In The Life.\"The woman in the title apparently gets the singer high on marijuana. This is the first time The Beatles used a direct reference to pot in a song. Bob Dylan introduced the band to marijuana when they met on August 28, 1964 in a New York City hotel. Dylan was surprised The Beatles hadn't tried it before, as he thought the line \"I Can't Hide\" in \"I Want To Hold Your Hand\" was \"I get high.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Written and recorded the same day, this song was used as the B-side of \"I Feel Fine.\"McCartney has acknowledged Little Richard as big influence, which is apparent on his vocals for this song.A chocalho, which is a type of metal shaker, was used for percussion.In 1965, a Tex-Mex group called the Sir Douglas Quintet released a song called \"She's About A Mover\" which was a direct rip-off of this. That song hit #13 in the US.The British new wave pop band Scritti Politti recorded a cover with Shabba Ranks, which peaked at #20 on the UK singles charts in 1991. Scritti Politti frontman Green Gartside recalled to Mojo magazine March 2011, the ragga star turned up at the studio, \"mob-deep with guns, everything. His manager Clifton 'The Specalist' Dillon would physically get a hold of Shabba while Shabba was on the mike and thump him so he could feel the rhythm.\"","shes_leaving_home":"This was based on a newspaper story Paul McCartney read about a runaway girl. On February 27th, 1967 the London Daily Mail's headline read: \"A-level girl dumps car and vanishes.\" That girl was 17-year-old Melanie Coe, who had ran away from home leaving everything behind. Her father was quoted as saying, \"I cannot imagine why she should run away, she has everything here.\" McCartney said in 1000 UK #1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh, \"We'd seen that story and it was my inspiration. There was a lot of these at the time and that was enough to give us the storyline. So I started to get the lyrics: she slips out and leaves a note and the parents wake up, it was rather poignant. I like it as a song and when I showed it to John, he added the Greek chorus and long sustained notes. One of the nice things about the structure of the song is that it stays on those chords endlessly.\"Melanie Coe, who became an estate agency director, told Dave Simpson her story in a 2008 interview for The Guardian. Said Coe: \"London was a very different place in the '60s. I went to a club called the Bag O' Nails [Soho] and I met everybody. You sat on the next table to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Hollies, because there weren't many clubs in London. I got in coz I was a cute little girl and I dressed in the latest fashions. I'd go to Mary Quant and Biba, sketch the dress and get my aunt to make my clothes. Ready Steady Go! loved that. They held open auditions. I was 13. It went on what you were wearing and how you danced. I was asked to come every week. I met the Beatles at Ready Steady Go! George was great to meet - I looked a lot like Pattie Boyd, who later became his wife, of course.I was always going out. I danced the night away and was a face in London. In those days, to be trendy everything had to be French. I bought the T-shirt of the moment, which was my star sign in French. I loved that T-shirt. One day I got home and my mother had cut it to ribbons. She wanted me to look like Princess Anne, not my idol, Marianne Faithfull. When my parents found out I had the pill they grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and made me flush them down the toilet.I was 17 by then and ran away leaving a note, just like in the song. I went to a doctor and he said I was pregnant, but I didn't know that before I left home. My best friend at the time was married to Ritchie Blackmore, so she hid me at their house in Holloway Road. It was the first place my parents came to look, so I ran off with my boyfriend, who was a croupier, although he had been 'in the motor trade' like it says in the song. I think my dad called up the newspapers - my picture was on the front pages. He made out that I must have been kidnapped, because why would I leave? They gave me everything - coats, cars. But not love. My parents found me after three weeks and I had an abortion.I didn't realize for a long time that the song was about me. Years later Paul was on a program talking about how he'd seen a newspaper article and been inspired by it. My mother pieced it all together and called me to say, 'That song's about you!'I can't listen to the song. It's just too sad for me. My parents died a long time ago and we were never resolved. That line, 'She's leaving home after living alone for so many years' is so weird to me because that's why I left. I was so alone. How did Paul know that those were the feelings that drove me towards one-night stands with rock stars? I don't think he can have possibly realized that he'd met me when I was 13 on Ready Steady Go!, but when he saw the picture, something just clicked.\"No Beatles played instruments on this. John and Paul contributed vocals, which were double-tracked to sound like a quartet, and session musicians played strings. The first female to play on a Beatles album, Sheila Bromberg, played harp. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)The string section was arranged by Mike Leander because producer George Martin was busy. Leander would later arrange strings for The Rolling Stones on \"As Tears Go By.\"Some of the lyrics were things John Lennon's Aunt Mimi said to him as a child. She raised John after his parents separated.In 1988 this was covered by Billy Bragg as part of the children's charity project album Sgt. Pepper Knew My Father. His version was released as a single in the UK as part of a double A side with Wet Wet Wet's version of \"With A Little Help From My Friends.\" The double A sided single topped the UK charts for four weeks.Nilsson covered this, along with \"You Can't Do That,\" for his 1967 breakthrough album, Pandemonium Shadow Show. Shortly after, the Beatles named Nilsson as their favorite singer.","slow_down":"This was originally recorded by the New Orleans R\u0026B singer Larry Williams, who was groomed by Specialty Records to replace Little Richard after he left Rock for religion. The Beatles covered 2 other Williams songs as well: \"Bad Boy\" and \"Dizzy Miss Lizzie.\" The only other artist who The Beatles covered 3 times is Carl Perkins.Although he was never a superstar in America, Larry Williams was quite influential in the UK, which is why the Beatles recorded so many of his songs. Most of the Williams covers were released in the UK before they were released stateside. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Nick Duckett of Rhythmandbluesrecords explains:Lyrically in the same territory as \"You Can't Do That,\" \"Slow Down\" is unusual in having a long thirty-second instrumental introduction. The original, although recorded in Los Angeles, features a New Orleans big-band sound using top musicians from the Crescent City. They play the in-vogue beat of 1958, the big-snare back-beat with a strong accent on beats 2 and 4. Earl Palmer is arguably the most influential drummer of modern times. He worked out a brand new beat during the recording of Fats Domino's The Fat Man, the four-to-the-floor beat, which Holland, Dozier and Holland adopted as their very own for early Motown productions, and he was one of the pioneers of this new beat, which became known as the rock backbeat. Palmer incidentally was the first musician to use the expression \"funky\" in referring to a syncopated and more danceable beat. Where Williams' band features an archetypal rock'n'roll saxophone break from Plas Johnson, the Beatles 1964 version of \"Slow Down\" contains a simple but effective guitar solo from George and the boys wrap it up with an added sixth-chord ending as in \"She Loves You.\"Although this was cut at the same Carl Perkins-attended session which produced \"Matchbox,\" the A-side of this single, a piano was overdubbed by George Martin 3 days later.","something":"This was released as a double A-side single with \"Come Together.\" It was the only song written by George Harrison released as a single by The Beatles. They had used some of his songs as B-sides, including \"The Inner Light\" and \"Old Brown Shoe.\"Harrison wrote this during a break while they were working on The White Album. It was not recorded in time for the album, so Harrison gave this to Joe Cocker, but Cocker didn't release it until after The Beatles did.This seemed to be inspired by Harrison's wife, Pattie, but he claimed he did not have anyone in mind when he wrote it. George was really into his studies of Krishna Consciousness when he wrote the song, and its original intent was as a devotion to Lord Krishna. In fact, the lyric was \"something in the way HE moves,\" but George ended up changing it because he didn't want to be perceived as a \"poof.\"Pattie did inspire \"Layla\" when Eric Clapton realized he loved her a few years later. She and Clapton were married from 1979-1988 (he also wrote \"Wonderful Tonight\" for her).In her 2007 book Wonderful Tonight: George Harrison, Eric Clapton, and Me, Pattie Boyd wrote: \"George wrote a song called 'Something.' He told me in a matter-of-fact way that he had written it for me. I thought it was beautiful and it turned out to be the most successful song he ever wrote, with more than 150 cover versions. George's favorite version was the one by James Brown. Mine was the one by George Harrison, which he played to me in our kitchen. But, in fact, by then our relationship was in trouble. Since a trip to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in India in 1968, George had become obsessive about meditation. He was also sometimes withdrawn and depressed.\"Harrison came up with the title and the first line after listening to a James Taylor song called \"Something In The Way She Moves.\" Taylor was signed to Apple Records (The Beatles' label) at the time.This is the only song on the Beatles 1 album that was not a #1 hit on its own in the US or UK. \"Something\" and \"Come Together\" spent one week at #1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart when the compilers of the chart changed its ranking method and stopped giving separate rankings for the two sides of a single. It was also gave Harrison representation among the 27 tracks. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE) Frank Sinatra called this \"The greatest love song ever written.\" He often performed it in the '70s, at one point wrongly attributing it to Lennon and McCartney rather than Harrison.Harrison had the first line, \"Something in the way she moves,\" but had trouble coming up with the second. He considered \"attracts me like a pomegranate,\" before coming up with \"attracts me like no other lover.\"This was used in a commercial for Chrysler cars in 1987.With at least 200 cover versions on record, this is the second-most-covered Beatles song; only \"Yesterday\" has been covered more.John Lennon said that this was his favorite song on Abbey Road.Harrison wrote this on a piano. The Beatles often composed and recorded separately at this time.Harrison pictured Ray Charles on vocals when he wrote this. Charles did eventually cover it.With 21 string players used in overdubs, this ended up being one of the most orchestral Beatles songs. This sound made it a staple of light rock radio and, in bowlderized instrumental form, Muzak.Before this was edited down, it contained a long instrumental tag at the end. (thanks, Barry Kesten - Bellmore, United States)Harrison chastised McCartney for being too active with his bass lines in this song. In the past, Paul had always been very critical of George's guitar playing on his songs. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)Dave Grohl, a former member of Nirvana and leader of The Foo Fighters, recorded a tribute song to Harrison on the Foo's first album called \"Oh, George\" based on the guitar lead to this. Harrison was Grohl's favorite Beatle, and this was one of the first leads he learned to play on guitar.As a tribute to George Harrison, Paul McCartney played a version of this on his 2002 tour using a ukulele George had given him.Jeff Lynne, Joe Walsh and Dhani Harrison performed this song on the CBS special The Beatles: The Night That Changed America. The show featured Grammy-winning performers covering Beatles songs; it aired on February 9, 2014 - the 50th anniversary of the group's first Ed Sullivan Show appearance.","strawberry_fields_forever":"Strawberry Field was a Salvation Army home in Liverpool where John Lennon used to go. He had fond memories of the place that inspired this. In 1984, Lennon's widow Yoko Ono donated $375,000 to the home. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)John's aunt Mimi did not like John going to Strawberry Fields, as it was basically an orphanage and she thought they would lead John astray. John liked going there because having lost his father and later his mother he felt a kinship to the lads. When John and his aunt would argue about his going he would often reply, \"What are they going to do, hang me?\" Thus the line \"Nothing to get hung about.\" In America, to be \"hung up\" is to worry about something, so many US listeners thought the line meant that it was nothing to get \"hung up about.\" (thanks, Ken - Hartland, MI)Lennon (from his 1980 interview with Playboy magazine): \"Strawberry Fields is a real place. After I stopped living at Penny Lane, I moved in with my auntie who lived in the suburbs in a nice semidetached place with a small garden and doctors and lawyers and that ilk living around... not the poor slummy kind of image that was projected in all the Beatles stories. In the class system, it was about half a class higher than Paul, George and Ringo, who lived in government-subsidized housing. We owned our house and had a garden. They didn't have anything like that. Near that home was Strawberry Fields, a house near a boys' reformatory where I used to go to garden parties as a kid with my friends Nigel and Pete we would go there and hang out and sell lemonade bottles for a penny. We always had fun at Strawberry Fields. So that's where I got the name. But I used it as an image. Strawberry Fields forever.\"Some of the lyrics reflect being misunderstood. Lennon added: \"The second line goes, 'No one I think is in my tree.' Well, what I was trying to say in that line is, 'Nobody seems to be as hip as me, therefore I must be crazy or a genius.'\" (thanks, Conrad - Los Angeles, CA)Lennon wrote this while he was in Spain working on a movie called How I Won The War. He house where he stayed was in Almeria, which is in the southeast corner of the country. (thanks, Michelle Hardman - Leeds, England)A distorted voice at the end sounds like \"I buried Paul,\" which fueled rumors that Paul McCartney was dead. The voice is actually Lennon saying, \"Cranberry sauce.\" Over the end credits of the Simpsons episode \"D'oh-in In The Wind,\" you can hear Homer saying \"I buried Flanders\" in reference to this. (thanks, Tommy - Flower Mound, TX)There is a memorial to Lennon in Central Park called \"Strawberry Fields.\" It is located across from The Dakota, the building in New York City where Lennon lived.John donated money to Strawberry Fields before his death. One of its buildings is named \"Lennon Hall.\"This was released as the flip side of \"Penny Lane.\" The Beatles often released singles that contained a song written by Lennon on one side, and a song written by McCartney on the other. Which single was considered the A-side was sometimes a point of contention.This was the first Beatles single to break their long-running streak of #1 hits in the UK. If they had not released it with \"Penny Lane,\" they would have beaten the existing #1 by a large margin, but stores recorded sales for one side of the single or the other, which hurt the chart position for this song.Two versions were recorded with different instruments and spliced together to make one song. Where Lennon's vocal wanders during \"going to;\" after that point, the second take is slowed down, which causes the vocal to have more of a nasal sound.The story goes that John Lennon couldn't decide on which of the two versions to release, so he left George Martin with the instruction to try an put them together. Martin was flabbergasted - they were in different keys and different tempos! But he found that by speeding up the first part and slowing down the second, he could made the two roughly match. The \"magical mystery\" edit occurs at exactly :59 seconds in, between the words \"Let me take you down, 'cause I'm\" /edit/ \"Going to.. Strawberry Fields.\" Be cautious in listening for this edit! You will never hear this song the same way again. Martin was never completely pleased with the edit, but it just goes to show how creative and innovative the aging geniuses had become by the late '60s. (thanks to Dwight Rounds, author of The Year The Music Died, 1964-1972)John Lennon played the intro to the song on a Mellotron. The Mellotron is a keyboard that triggers loops of recorded taped instruments at different pitches. It is not a synthesized sound at all, but recordings of actual instruments. This song used flutes as the tape loops. The unique sound comes from warble in the tape during playback. Strings were another popular tape loop used in the Mellotron, used by the Moody Blues on Days of Future Passed. (thanks, Michael De Lazzer - Studio City, CA, for above 2)This was the first pop song that faded to silence and then came back. The fake ending drove DJs nuts.The working title was \"It's Not Too Bad.\" (thanks, Mike - Mountlake Terrace, Washington)Just after Lennon sings, \"Let me take you down 'cause I'm going to,\" there is a series of beeps which, in Morse Code, form the letters \"J\" and \"L.\" (thanks, Buddy - South Bend, IN)On January 30, 1967, The Beatles shot a promo film for this song, which was one of the first and most successful music videos, featuring stop motion animation and other special effects. It was filmed in and around Knole Park, an estate owned by the National Trust, near Sevenoaks in Kent. The tree that features prominently in the video is behind the park's birdhouse. The director of these videos was Peter Foldmann, a Swedish friend of Klaus Voormann, who was associated with the Beatles in their early days in Hamburg and later designed the Revolver album cover. The following day the Beatles filmed a promo film for \"Penny Lane\" also at Knole Park.Peter Gabriel covered this in 1975 on the compilation All This And World War II.\"Strawberry Fields Forever\" is the name of a US fan club that publishes a popular Beatles magazine.Cyndi Lauper performed this at the Strawberry Fields memorial in Central Park as part of the 2001 special Come Together: A Night For John Lennon's Words And Music. Proceeds from the show went to victims of the September 11 attacks on America.It turns out Strawberry Fields is not forever. In 2005, Britain's Salvation Army closed the Strawberry Field children's home in Liverpool, stating that it's preferable for children to be raised in a foster or small group home instead of a large orphanage. The home opened in 1936, and Lennon left money to Strawberry Field in his will. His widow, Yoko Ono, donated the equivalent of $70,000 in 1984 to keep the home open. Only 3 children remained in the home in January 2005, when the Salvation Army announced it would close. (thanks, Tom - Seneca, SC)Vanilla Fudge does a series of fractured covers of this song on the second side of their debut album. It is split up into four parts, titled \"STRA\" \"WBER\" \"RYFI\" and \"ELDS.\" At the end of their cover of Eleanor Rigby, they sing \"Nothing is real\" and \"Nothing to get hung about.\" (thanks, Jim - Oxnard, CA)Richie Havens opened the Woodstock festival in 1969. He performed this and \"Hey Jude \" in his set.The Victorian house at the Strawberry Fields orphanage in Liverpool was torn down in 1977, and was replaced with a rectangular house named Lennon Hall.Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails owns the Mellotron played at the beginning of this song. (thanks, Leslie - Mountainville, NY, for above 2)On an episode of the TV show Lost, the character Charlie Pace has some lyrics to this song on his arm. The tattoo reads, \"Living is easy with eyes closed.\" (thanks, Hermione - Los Angeles, CA)George Martin revealed at a 2008 LA presentation for members of the National Recording Academy of Arts and Sciences, that Lennon told him before he died in 1980 that he wished he could re-record everything the Beatles ever did. When the astonished Beatles producer asked, \"Even 'Strawberry Fields?,'\" Lennon answered, \"Especially 'Strawberry Fields!'\"On this track, George Harrison played the swarmandal, an Indian instrument that some say sounds like a harp, but actually has more similarity to a zither. (thanks, Annabelle - Eugene, OR)Later in 1967, another famous musical strawberry emerged when a group called the Strawberry Alarm Clock had a #1 US hit with \"Incense And Peppermints.\" A common rumor was that the band based their name on this song, but they were actually told by their record company to use \"strawberry,\" as Donovan's \"Mellow Yellow,\" with the \"electrical banana,\" brought psychedelic imagery to fruit. The group, who were from California, faked a British look and sound at first, and were originally called Thee Sixpence.","sun_king":"John Lennon wrote this song. He used to say that he dreamed 'Sun King,' but it's possible that he was also reading a book with that title by Nancy Mitford about the life of Louis XIV of France (The \"Sun King\" was a nickname given to King Louis XIV). He also was poking a bit of fun at George Harrison's \"Here Comes The Sun.\" At one point the title was \"Here Comes the Sun King.\"The foreign part of the song is a garbled mixture of Spanish and Italian, which roughly translates to: \"When for much my love of happy heart, world paparazzi my love green for warm sun, hill as much much that small carousel.\" \"Paparazzi\" has the same meaning in Italian as it does in English. (thanks, Spencer - Los Angeles, CA)This was recorded as one song with \"Mean Mr. Mustard.\" It's part of a suite of songs at the end of Abbey Road. They put together bits of unfinished songs to make up most of Side 2.The Beatles got the idea to use reverb on this after hearing Fleetwood Mac's \"Albatross.\"In 2006, a backwards version of this song called \"Gnik Nus\" was included on the album Love, which was a soundtrack to the Cirque du Soleil show featuring the music of The Beatles. (thanks, Mike - Chicago, IL)","taxman":"George Harrison wrote this song. The music was inspired by the theme song for the popular 1960s TV series Batman, which was written and originally recorded by the conductor/trumpeter Neal Hefti, and covered by the surf rock group The Marketts early in 1966 in a version that hit #17 in the US. Harrison was a big fan of the show.This was the first track on Revolver. It was the first song Harrison wrote that was given such prominent position, indicating that he was capable of writing songs as good as Lennon and McCartney's.This is a bitter song about how much money The Beatles were paying in taxes. People with high earnings pay exorbitant taxes in England. Many successful entertainers leave the country so they can keep more of their money. As a result, The Beatles - as well as The Who and The Rolling Stones - spent a lot of time in America and other parts of Europe as \"tax exiles.\"George Harrison said: \"Taxman was when I first realized that even though we had started earning money, we were actually giving most of it away in taxes.\"\"Mr. Wilson\" and \"Mr. Heath\" are mentioned in the lyrics. They are British Prime Ministers Harold Wilson and Edward Heath, who were being scorned in the song for contributing to English tax laws. Before this song was released, Wilson had presented The Beatles with the award for England's Show Business Personalities of 1963 at the Variety Club of Great Britain Annual Show Business Awards held on March 19, 1964 in London. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Revolver is the only album on which Harrison has 3 songs. On all the others he only has 2 or less. On The White Album he had 4, but it was a double album so he was only allotted his usual one track per-side. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)The fade-out ending is a reprise of the guitar solo as all completed takes of the song ended with John and Paul singing \"Taxman!\" (thanks, Brad Wind - Miami, FL)There's been a lot of confusion over who played lead guitar on this track. Harrison said in his 1977 Crawdaddy interview: \"I helped out such a lot in all the arrangements. There were a lot of tracks though where I played bass. Paul played lead guitar on 'Taxman,' and he played guitar - a good part - on 'Drive My Car.\"Jeff Emerick said in his book on recording the Beatles that Harrison just couldn't get the solo right, so Paul played most of the guitar parts, including the solo. The repeat of the solo at the end of the song was the same \"exact\" solo by Paul, which Jeff dubbed from the middle of the song to another piece of tape and cut into the fade at the end.Seth Swirsky, who worked as a staff songwriter before producing the Beatles documentary Beatles Stories, told us: \"I think Paul McCartney was one of the greatest guitar players of the '60s. Nobody really recognized him as an electric guitar player, or an acoustic guitar player, but his leads on 'Taxman' and on different songs that you think George played, they ripped. I think George is great, but when Paul played lead on some songs, they tore. They were just very unique. There's no one like Paul McCartney in the history of the world.\" (Check out our full interview with Seth Swirsky.)In 2002, H\u0026R Block used this in commercials for their tax preparation service. The ads aired shortly after Harrison died.The 1,2,3,4 count-in is fake, and was edited on as an afterthought. The real count-in (by Paul) can be heard underneath.The guitar solo at the end is a straight copy of the middle-eight. This same solo was later reused as a tape spool on \"Tomorrow Never Knows.\" (thanks, Mike - Mountlake Terrace, WA. U.S.A, for above 2)\"Weird Al\" Yankovic recorded a parody of this song called \"Pac-Man\" in 1981. It was never officially released on any of his albums, but a demo version can be found on Dr. Demento's Basement Tapes No. 4. The song is very faithful to the Beatles' original, plus some musical and well-placed Pac-Man sound effects. (thanks, Joe - Boston, MA)Blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan covered this song. His version sounds very different, but the lyrics are identical. (thanks, Rusty - Houston, TX)See a photo of Mr. Wilson and The Beatles in Song Images.Harrison put some math in the lyrics. In the beginning of the song, he sings, \"There's one for you, 19 for me\" before \"If 5 percent appears too small.\" One of 19 is 5 percent. (thanks, Tyler - Branford, CT)In his 1987 reminiscence \"When We Was Fab,\" it was clear that the taxation of long ago was still on George Harrison's mind, as he sang, \"Income tax was all we had.\"","tell_me_what_you_see":"This song was Paul McCartney's prototype for \"I'm Looking Through You.\" The lyrics deal with his romantic troubles. (thanks, Jon - Danville, CA)","tell_me_why":"John Lennon, whose parents separated when he was 3 years old, has said that the lyrics were about children whose parents split up. Apparently, he didn't put a great deal of effort into the song, staing: \"They needed another upbeat song, and I just knocked it off.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)This was performed in The Beatles movie A Hard Day's Night. It was The Beatles first movie, and the group was not yet popular in America when the deal was signed to make it. Before filming began, The Beatles became huge and the movie did very well.John and Paul sang lead vocals, but Lennon was double-tracked to create a 3 part harmony.This was recorded on Thursday, February 27, 1964. Take 8 was used. (thanks, Ben - Cheverly, MD)","thank_you_girl":"John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote this in response to the girls who sent them fan mail.Lennon wrote the verses for this song, with McCartney contributing the chorus. Lennon said it was \"just a silly song we knocked off.\"The mono version was originally released in Great Britain as a single on the Parlophone label as the B-side of \"From Me To You\" in April 1963, and in America on the VeeJay label in May 1963. It was eventually released on the Past Masters Vol. 1 CD in 1988. A slightly different stereo version was released in April 1964 on The Beatles Second Album, issued by Capitol records. That version is now available on CD with the release of The American Albums; Vol. 1 CDs.This is the first Beatles track featuring double-tracked vocals, which is a studio technique they often employed to make the vocals stand out. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","the_ballad_of_john_and_yoko":"This isn't really a ballad - it's uptempo. John Lennon wrote the song about his marriage to Yoko and their run-ins with various international authorities. They married on March 20, 1969 in Gibraltar and honeymooned in Amsterdam. John and Yoko's decision to get married came very suddenly on March 14, 1969, just two days after Paul McCartney married Linda Eastman. On March 14, John and Yoko were being driven to Poole in Dorset to visit John's Aunt Mimi. John asked his chauffeur Les Anthony to go to Southampton and ask about the possibility of getting married at sea. After learning that this was not possible, Lennon decided to go to Paris, and called his office instructing his staff to arrange a quiet wedding there. Peter Brown discovered that getting married in Paris on such short notice was impossible, but that they could marry in Gibraltar, because it was a British protectorate, and Lennon was a British citizen.The line \"Christ, you know it ain't easy\" caused a great deal of controversy and got the song banned by the BBC and most US radio stations.After the wedding, John and Yoko flew to Amsterdam and invited the press to join them in their room. Some reporters thought they were being called in to witness the couple consummate their marriage (John and Yoko appeared nude on the cover of their 1968 Two Virgins album), but what they got instead was a \"Bed-In,\" where John and Yoko protested the war from their bed - fully clothed.The Spanish guitar part at the end of the song was lifted from \"Lonesome Tears In My Eyes,\" a 1956 song by Johnny Burnette And The Rock N' Roll Trio. The Beatles played the song in their early years - their version can be found on the album Live At The BBC. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2)This was recorded and mixed in nine hours on the day it was written: April 14, 1969. John Lennon and Paul McCartney worked on this without the other Beatles because of the hastily called session. The B-side of the single was a song George Harrison wrote: \"Old Brown Shoe.\"This was the last true Lennon/McCartney compilation. They had been writing separately for the last few years.This was the last Beatles song to be recorded specifically as a single. Here's a the cover photo, which says a lot about the Beatles relationship at the time.In the UK, this single was released while \"Get Back\" was still at #1. It just missed (by one week) knocking \"Get Back\" off the top. \"The Ballad Of John and Yoko\" turned out to be the The Beatles 17th - and final - UK #1. (thanks, Martin - Ringmer, East Sussex, England)Not long after this song was released, John Lennon explained: \"When I get down to it, I'm only interested in Yoko and peace, so if I can sing about them again and again and again - its only like I'm going through my blue period as a painter. It's like he's gonna paint this cup for a year, you know, to get into that cup. So maybe I'm doing that.\"","the_beatles_movie_medley":"This contains parts of: \"Magical Mystery Tour,\" \"All You Need Is Love,\" \"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away,\" \"I Should Have Known Better,\" \"A Hard Day's Night,\" \"Ticket To Ride,\" and \"Get Back.\"The bigwigs of Capitol/EMI Records were motivated to make and release the single (and the accompanying LP, \"Reel Music\") after the surprise success of the Stars on 45 medleys and \"Beach Boys Medley\" (also on Capitol) in 1981.","the_continuing_story_of_bungalow_bill":"John Lennon called this quirky tune, \"A sort of teenage social-comment song and a bit of a joke.\"Lennon wrote this about a guy he met at the Maharishi's camp in India who loved to hunt. The four Beatles went on the retreat to study meditation, but were not impressed with the results.The hunter's name was Richard A. Cooke, and his wife Bronwyn explained in Mojo magazine September 2008 that Richard, \"had asked the Maharishi if it was a sin to kill a tiger. John and George were in the room. Maharishi's response was, 'Life destruction is Life destruction.' Rik has not shot anything since. He became a freelance photographer for National Geographic.\"Yoko Ono sang the line \"Not when he looked so fierce.\" It was the first female vocal on a Beatles song.The opening riff that sounds like a flamenco guitar was played on a Mellotron, which is a type of synthesizer.Why \"bungalow\"? At the ashram where The Beatles were visiting in India, guest stayed in luxury bungalows. The hunter they wrote the song about clearly was not into immersing himself in the culture, but more interested in the comfort of his bungalow.The Beatles recorded this in an overnight session. Everyone around the studio was invited to sing on the chorus. Ringo's wife Maureen sang harmony.The correct name of the LP this is on is actually called \"The Beatles.\" It became known as \"The White Album\" because of it's stark white cover. (thanks, Chet - Saratoga Springs, NY)","the_end":"The line \"In the end the love you take is equal to the love you make\" is essentially the Beatles closing statement. It is the last lyric on the last album they recorded. Let It Be was the last album they released, but it was recorded earlier.This starts over the end of \"Carry That Weight,\" and is the last song in a suite at the end of the Abbey Road album.Lennon, McCartney and Harrison took turns doing guitar solos. If you listen closely, you can hear how the styles change from one to the other. This is the only time in the Beatles' history that they traded riffs. (thanks, Matt - Lancaster, PA)The phrase \"Love You\" is repeated 24 times.On this song, you can hear the only drum solo Ringo Starr ever performed as a Beatle. He hated solos and had to be persuaded to do it, with McCartney convincing him that the drum fill was necessary as a transition. Ringo later said that he could never re-create the solo if he tried.This ends with a 30-piece orchestra.When Paul McCartney was on Saturday Night Live, he did the skit \"Chris Farley's Talk Show,\" in which Chris was really nervous to be talking to a Beatle, and you can see it from his disheveled look, sweat, and stuttering. One funny part is when Chris asks, \"Do you remember when you said 'in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make?'\" To which Paul responds \"yes\" in such a serious, and slightly irritated, way that you can't help but laugh. (thanks, Natasha - Chico, CA)According to Geoff Emerick who engineered the album, the guitar solos are in this order; Paul, George,and John. Paul wanted to go first and John wanted to go last. (thanks, Phil - New Britain, CT)","the_fool_on_the_hill":"Paul McCartney wrote this song. It's about a man who is considered a fool by others, but whose foolish demeanor is actually an indication of wisdom.An event which prompted this song happened when Paul was walking his dog, Martha, on Primrose Hill one morning. As he watched the sun rise, he noticed that Martha was missing. Paul turned around to look for his dog, and there a man stood, who appeared on the hill without making a sound. The gentleman was dressed respectably, in a belted raincoat. Paul knew this man had not been there seconds earlier as he had looked in that direction for Martha. Paul and the stranger exchanged a greeting, and this man then spoke of what a beautiful view it was from the top of this hill that overlooked London. Within a few seconds, Paul looked around again, and the man was gone. He had vanished as he had appeared. A friend of McCartney's, Alistair Taylor, was present with Paul during this strange incident, and wrote of this event in his book, Yesterday.Both Paul and Alistair could not imagine what happened to this man. He had seemed to vanish in thin air. The nearest trees for cover were too far to reach by walking or running in a few seconds, and the crest of the hill was too far as well to reach in that short time. What made the experience even more mysterious, was that just before this man first appeared, Paul and Alistair were speaking to each other of the beauty they observed of the view towards London and the existence of God. Once back home, they spent the morning discussing what had happened, trying to make some sense of it. They both agreed that this was something others were infer occurred as a result of an \"acid trip,\" but they both swore they had not taken or used any drugs. When Paul filmed the sequence for this song in the film, it shows him on a hilltop overlooking the town of Nice. (thanks, Gavin - Hampden, MA)Paul played this for John Lennon while they were writing \"A Little Help From My Friends.\" John made him write down the words so he wouldn't forget.This began as a solo composition with Paul McCartney at the piano. Flutes were added last.This was not a hit for The Beatles, but a 1968 cover version by Sergio Mendes \u0026 Brasil '66 went to #6 in the US.This was used in the Beatles movie Magical Mystery Tour.The Eurythmics (Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart) reunited to perform this song on the CBS special The Beatles: The Night That Changed America, which aired on February 9, 2014 - exactly 50 years after The Beatles first appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show.","the_inner_light":"George Harrison wrote this song. It was released as the B-side of \"Lady Madonna\" and was Harrison's first song to appear on a single.All the music was recorded by Indian session musicians at the EMI studios in Bombay, India, while George was working on the soundtrack to the movie Wonderwall.George Harrison had originally recorded this for the Wonderwall soundtrack in January 1968. When The Beatles got together for recording sessions shortly before their trip to India, John and Paul added harmonies to the final line, \"Do all without doing.\" (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)The lyrics are a translation of a section of the Tao Te Ching. Juan Mascaro, a Sanskrit teacher at Cambridge University, sent the book to George.This was Harrison's last Indian-themed Beatles song.The original release was in mono; a stereo version was mixed in 1970 and used on the Past Masters compilation. The mono mix features an extra Indian instrument in the intro that did not make it to the stereo version.Jeff Lynne from Electric Light Orchestra performed this at George Harrison's 2002 memorial show The Concert For George. Lynne was good friends with Harrison and played with him in The Traveling Wilburys. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2)","the_long_and_winding_road":"One of the last Beatles songs, Paul McCartney wrote this based on tensions within the band.The road McCartney is talking about is the B842 which runs down the east coast of Kintyre and on into Campbeltown near his Scottish farmhouse. (thanks, Mike - Mountlake Terrace, WA)McCartney: \"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)The Beatles recorded this in January 1969 as a fairly simple ballad. By 1970, The Beatles were breaking up and and Phil Spector was brought in to go through the tapes and produce the album. Spector was known for his \"Wall Of Sound\" recording technique, where he added many instruments and layered the tracks to create a very full sound. On this track, he took out most of The Beatles instruments and added a string section and choir (The Mike Sammes Singers). The result was very different from what the group originally had in mind. Even though he wrote this song, Paul McCartney didn't go to the sessions where Spector produced it. When McCartney heard the results, he made it clear that he hated what Spector did to his song, and tried to get the original version, which was mixed by engineer Glyn Johns, on the album. The band was already falling apart, and this caused further turmoil within the group, as Harrison and Lennon both supported Spector. Paul has not changed his stance over the years, and still believes Spector butchered it. Lennon and Harrison felt otherwise, and each had Spector produce their next solo efforts. Lennon said of Spector's work on Let It Be: \"Phil was given the s--ttiest load of badly recorded s--t with a lousy feeling to it, and he made something of it.\"The Beatles performed this in the movie Let It Be. Both the movie and album were the last The Beatles released. Abbey Road was the last album they recorded.Paul McCartney offered this song to Tom Jones in 1968 on the condition it be his next single. He had \"Without Love (There is Nothing)\" set for release so he turned down the offer, something he would later regret. Speaking with Media Wales in 2012, Jones explained: \"I saw him (McCartney) in a club called Scotts Of St James on Jermyn Street in London. I said to him When are you going to write me a song then Paul? He said, aye I will then. Then not long after he sent a song around to my house, which was 'The Long And Winding Road,' but the condition was that I could do it but it had to be my next single.Paul wanted it out straight away. At that time I had a song called 'Without Love' that I was going to be releasing. The record company was gearing up towards the release of it. The timing was terrible, but I asked if we could stop everything and I could do 'The Long And Winding Road.' They said it would take a lot of time and it was impractical, so I ended up not doing it. I was kicking myself. I knew it was a strong song.\"\"Without Love\" did well for Jones - it reached #5 in the US and #10 in the UK, but didn't have anywhere near the staying power of this Beatles classic. Jones did eventually record a Paul McCartney song, but not until 2012 when Paul wrote \"(I Want To) Go Home,\" which was released on Jones' album Spirit In The Room.This was the only Beatles song where John Lennon played bass. He was ordinarily their rhythm guitarist. Harrison and Ringo had their parts removed by Phil Spector, so they don't appear on this at all.Alistair Taylor, the General manager at Apple Records, witnessed Paul McCartney's recording of the original demo version of this at 3 in the morning. He recalls in 1000 UK #1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh: \"He was picking out a melody and I said 'I like that, it's a fabulous melody,' and he said, 'It's just an idea.' He told the engineer to switch on the tape and he recorded 'The Long And Winding Road' then and there: it was full of la-las as he'd only written a few lines, but it was quite fantastic.\"McCartney blocked release of the song as a single in the UK, but he could not prevent its release in the US where it topped the charts for 2 weeks. (thanks, Edward Pearce - Ashford, Kent, England, for above 2)This was one of 5 Beatles songs McCartney played on his 1976 Wings Over America tour.n 2002 a cover version by Pop Idol winner Will Young and runner-up Gareth Gates topped the UK chart.In 2003, Apple Records released a new version of the album called Let It Be... Naked, with Spector's production removed. For this song, a previously unreleased take was used when it was remixed. This version is what McCartney had in mind when he wrote the song.Ringo's drums can be heard both on the Anthology 3 version and Spector's version (Spector's version just has the strings on top of the Anthology 3 version). (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)Brazilian singer Caetano Veloso begins his song \"It's a long way\" with the lines, \"Woke up this morning singing an old Beatles song.\" A few verses later he says, \"It's a long and winding road.\" The song is in his 1972 British album Transa. (thanks, Marcos - Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)Some of the many artists who covered this song: Tony Bennett, George Benson, Cilla Black, Ray Charles, Cher, Judy Collins, Peter Frampton, Aretha Franklin, Richie Havens, Cissy Houston, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Liberace, The London Symphony Orchestra, Barry Manilow, Mantovani, Johnny Mathis, Bill Medley, George Michael, Olivia Newton-John, Billy Ocean, Stu Phillips, Kenny Rogers, Diana Ross, Kevin Rowland, Sarah Vaughan, Andy Williams and Nancy Wilson. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)In an interview shortly before he became British Prime Minister, after five years of Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron told Q magazine that this is his favorite Paul McCartney song. He explained; \"It has a wonderful melody and emotion and pretty much sums up the life of the Leader of the Opposition.\"This became The Beatles 20th and last US #1 song on June 13, 1970.","the_night_before":"One of the lesser-known Beatles songs, many fans consider it one of their more underrated pieces. It's a light Pop song about relationship troubles, featuring John Lennon and George Harrison's harmonies backing up Paul McCartney's lead vocals. McCartney wrote the song. (thanks, auds - aberdeenshire, Scotland)The Beatles performed this on the Salisbury Plain in their second film, Help!.John Lennon played a Hohner Pianet electric piano on this track, which he can be seen playing in the movie.The Country music band Restless Heart recorded this on their 2004 album Still Restless. (thanks, Maya - Richmond, BC, for above 3)","the_word":"This is another brilliant musical innovation from the Rubber Soul album, the first point at which The Beatles shrugged off the \"mop tops\" image and went for bolder artistic horizons. \"The Word\" sounds almost like evangelizing; as opposed to a standard boy-girl love song, the lyrics here embrace love as more of a concept, the way the Flower Power movement was thinking about it.The lyrics of \"The Word\" also mark an important point at which The Beatles began to realize that they were, in fact, spokespeople for a new generation. Their songs started packing a stronger message, bridging their way to the future when John and George would make their lyrics more political.Lead vocals on this song were shared by John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison. Beatles producer George Martin played the harmonium, an organ-like keyboard instrument.Yoko Ono gave the sheet music of this song as a gift to the composer John Cage, who later published it in his book Notations. Ono studied under Cage, even sharing the occasional stage with him, before she met John Lennon.Out of all the zillions of times that music fans claim that something was composed on drugs, this is one of the rare times when a performer actually states that they did drugs while creating it. Paul McCartney reported in interviews that they'd blazed some reefer before setting down to do the lyrics, and reports that far from enhancing their ability, it actually got in the way.In 2002, Joan Jett covered this for the album, It's All About Eve (Music For The Cure), a charity compilation to support breast cancer research. It was produced by Rob Stevens, who had worked with John Lennon.Rubber Soul is often cited as the first album issued without the artist's name on its cover, but that honor really goes to Elvis Presley for his 1959 album For LP Fans Only. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","theres_a_place":"This was one of John Lennon's first attempts to write a song in the style of the Motown girl-groups.In this song, Lennon sings about the places he retreats to in his mind, although without a careful listen the song seems to be about a girl.This appeared on the soundtrack for the 1963 TV documentary Beat City, which is a look at the Liverpool music scene that aired on Britain's Associated-Rediffusion network. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for all above)","things_we_said_today":"Paul McCartney wrote this while he was on vacation in The Bahamas and away from his girlfriend. Along with McCartney on the yacht voyage were Ringo Starr and his girlfriend and future wife Maureen. McCartney told interviewer Barry Miles: \"I got away from the main party but it was a bit queasy downstairs; you could smell the oil and the boat was rocking a bit and I'm not the best sailor in the world, so I wrote a little bit of it downstairs and then the rest of it on the back deck where you couldn't smell the engine.\" Kind of accounts for the dour mood if you're seasick.\"Things We Said Today\" was recorded at the legendary Abbey Road Studios, home to The Beatles for most of their career together and given its tribute in the Abbey Road album. A Hard Day's Night was the first Beatles studio album recorded at Abbey. Abbey Road started out as a nine-bedroom townhouse built in 1930, before being converted into apartments. Gramophone bought the property in 1930, and converted it into a studio. The first European rock 'n' roll song to be recorded at Abbey Road was Cliff Richards' \"Move It,\" released 1958.Maureen McGovern recorded this and \"For No One\" as a 2-song medley for her 1992 album Baby I'm Yours. Other acts to cover this song include Dick Rivers, Mary McCaslin, Jackie DeShannon, Dwight Yoakam, and one pastiche version by Beatles-parody act The Rutles.In the UK, this song was used as the B-side of the UK single release of \"A Hard Day's Night,\" which was a far more up-tempo and rollicking song.McCartney's vocal was double-tracked to make it stand out.","think_for_yourself":"Written by George Harrison, this was one of his first songs included on a Beatles album. He took on more of a songwriting role in his later years with The Beatles and as a solo artist.This song can be a shock the first time you hear it. It takes the typical \"silly love songs\" trope characteristic of The Beatles at the time and stands it right on its nose, by being an actual breakup song. And a dark and sour one at that! Paul McCartney played his bass through a distortion box to get a fuzz effect that dominates the song, snarling like an angry dog. The lyrics are saturated with negative words: \"misery,\" \"lies,\" \"ruins.\" The downbeat tune sounds like the end of the world is coming, almost over-dramatic.The album Rubber Soul marks the point at which The Beatles starting breaking out of their \"Fab Four\" image and started growing artistically. Critics went nuts over it. \"Think For Yourself\" is an excellent example, seeing George Harrison finally come into his own as a songwriter and Paul McCartney experimenting with the fuzz bass. Even Ringo playing the maracas and John Lennon lending that folk-rock edge with the tambourine.Producer George Martin was also developing artistically, experimenting with an eye towards making the album sound good on either a stereo or monaural player. So Harrison's vocals on \"Think For Yourself\" is double-tracked, then split between the right and left channels.Note the slight wobble in the group's harmonics - for instance, in the word 'time' on the lyric \"you've got time to rectify all the things that you should.\" It comes in just a little higher, sounding slightly more strained or sharper. This might be partly a deliberate effect, but the various vocal quirks on Rubber Soul also are an effect of the rushed recording to get the album in the can by Christmas. Still, these small imperfections also give the whole album a warmer, more natural feeling.In 1968, this was included in The Beatles movie Yellow Submarine.","this_boy":"John Lennon wrote this song. One of his early compositions, it is seemingly simple, but very clever. The song contains only a few notes, but the space between the notes is filled by the arrangements. It's the same technique you hear in Liszt's \"Liebestraum,\" the piano piece in Schumann's Davidsbündlertänze and in Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata.\"This was the first Beatles composition that was commented on by a music critic. William Mann wrote in The London Times December 27, 1963, that the song had \"pendiatonic clusters.\" (thanks to Johan Cavalli, who is a music historian in Stockholm, for above 2)George Harrison: \"It was John (Lennon) trying to do Smokey (Robinson).\"The vocals were a three part harmony sung by Harrison, Lennon and McCartney.The Beatles performed this on their second Ed Sullivan Show appearance - Feb 16, 1964. They played six songs on the show that night, and this provided a slow change of pace from the uptempo songs like \"She Loves You\" and \"I Want To Hold Your Hand.\" The Beatles were just beginning their breakthrough in America and got a huge audience from the show.This was used in Ringo's big scene in The Beatles movie A Hard Day's Night. The version used in the film is an instrumental renamed \"Ringo's Theme (This Boy),\" and without any harmony singing.This was one of the first songs on which The Beatles used a 4-track recorder. (thanks, Jes - Mason City, IA)Artists to cover this song include Tom Baxter, David Bowie, Sean Lennon, George Martin, Delbert McClinton and The Nylons. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","ticket_to_ride":"According to A Hard Day's Write by Steve Turner, many Americans concluded the \"ticket\" was from British Railways, and \"ride\" was the town of Ryde on the Isle of Wight. McCartney confessed to his biographer Barry Miles that they were partly right. Paul had a cousin who ran a bar in Ryde and he and John had visited them there. Paul later mentioned that although the song was primarily about a girl riding out of the life of the narrator, they were conscious of the potential for a double meaning.Don Short, who traveled with the Beatles in the '60s, recalled that John coined the phrase \"Ticket to Ride\" for another meaning - The girls who worked the streets in Hamburg had to have a clean bill of health and the authorities would give them a card saying they were clean. Don later said that although he specifically recalls John telling him that, John could of been joking - you had to be careful with him like that. (thanks, Ant - Belleville, Canada, for above 2)John Lennon: \"That was one of the earliest heavy-metal records made.\"The brief but recognizable guitar solo was played by Paul McCartney, who was The Beatles bass player.This was used in the Beatles movie Help! in the scene where The Beatles ski... poorly. Copies of the original singer released on Capitol Records say: \"From The United Artists Release 'Eight Arms To Hold You',\" which was the original working title of Help! (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)This was the first Beatles song over 3 minutes, which started a trend to longer songs. \"You Won't See Me\" from Rubber Soul was the next 3-minute song. Yesterday And Today and Revolver each had one, and Sgt. Pepper had four, including two over 5 minutes.Longer songs continued over the rest of their albums. Their longest was \"I Want You (She's So Heavy),\" followed by \"Hey Jude .\" (thanks to Dwight Rounds, author of The Year The Music Died, 1964-1972)Ringo came up with a distinctive staccato drum pattern for this song which he talks about quite often, sometimes mentioning that he's a left-handed drummer trying to play right-handed.The Beatles taped a performance of this song that was broadcast on an episode of Ed Sullivan Show that aired September 12, 1965 (the last Ed Sullivan show broadcast in black and white). The Beatles recorded it prior to their Shea Stadium concert that took place August 15.The Carpenters covered this in 1969. It was their first single and also the name of their debut album.The Beatles were one of the first groups to make music videos, which were done so they could promote their songs without showing up at TV stations. They made one for \"Ticket To Ride\" in a shoot where they did four other songs as well. All of the footage was shot in the studio; this one saw the band performing in front of oversized tickets for trains and busses.","till_there_was_you":"This was written in 1957 for the Broadway musical The Music Man. It was written by songwriter Meredith Willson, who also wrote \"76 Trombones\" for the same musical as well as the seasonal favorite \"It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas.\"Paul McCartney loved show tunes and wanted to cover this. His favorite version was Peggy Lee's.The Beatles played this song, along with \"She Loves You\" and \"Twist And Shout,\" at the Royal Command Performance of 1963. Paul credited it to their \"Favorite American group, Sophie Tucker.\" (thanks, don - rapid city, SD)The Beatles performed this on their first Ed Sullivan Show appearance, February 9, 1964. This was a huge event, as Beatlemania had just come to America. This was the only song they played that night that was not one of their hits - they put it in to appeal to the older audience that was tuned in. As they played, the camera zoomed in on each Beatle and superimposed their first name. When it got to Lennon, it read, \"Sorry girls, he's married.\"This was also performed during the Beatles appearance on the Royal Variety Show on November 4, 1963. It was probably also appealing to the older audience and it provided a break between the up-tempo numbers, \"She Loves You\" and \"Twist and Shout.\" (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)","tomorrow_never_knows":"The title came from an expression Ringo Starr used. They chose it to take the edge off the heavy philosophical lyrics. Working titles for the song before Ringo gave them inspiration were \"Mark I\" and \"The Void.\"John Lennon wrote this, and described it as \"my first psychedelic song.\" It was inspired by Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert's book The Psychedelic Experience, which Lennon would read while tripping on LSD. Lennon recorded himself reading from the Tibetan Book of the Dead, played it back while tripping on LSD, and wrote the song.Each Beatle created strange sounds which were mixed in throughout the recording, often backward and in different speeds. McCartney had the idea for using tape loops to create effects.This used 16 tape loops. Several people remember standing around the room holding pencils for the tape to loop around and back into the recording machine as the various sound effects and instrumentation were faded in and out.The vocals were forced through a Leslie (revolving) speaker. Lennon desired the effect that the listener could hear the words but not hear him, like a group of Tibetan monks chanting on a mountain top.John Lennon used only one chord in this whole song, which creates a hypnotic feeling. For his vocals, he asked producer George Martin to make him sound like the Dali Lama.This was the first track recorded for the album yet the last on record.There are 2 guitar solos on this song - both were heavily processed.On May 6, 2012, this song was featured in an episode of the popular American TV series Mad Men. The episode was set in 1966, and part of the plot was the ad agency in the show helping a client capitalize on Beatlemania. This was a big deal, since Beatles songs are very rarely licensed for TV shows - at least in their original versions. Cover versions and performances (think American Idol) show up from time to time, since those just have to be approved by Sony/ATV, which owns the publishing rights. Getting permission to use an actual Beatles recording requires permission from Apple Corp, which is controlled by The Beatles and their heirs.The Wall Street Journal reported the payment for the song at $250,000, and Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner had to reveal to Apple exactly how the song would be used, which was a big deal since he is very secretive about scripts. In the episode, the main character Don Draper has trouble adapting to changing musical times. He plays this song to see what all the fuss is about, and after character-developing montage while the song is playing, he switches it off. The song then comes back to play over the closing credits.Phil Collins covered this on his debut solo album. Like The Beatles did on Revolver, Collins used it to close the album. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)Our Lady Peace remade this song for the soundtrack to the movie The Craft. It's played during the opening credits. (thanks, Patrick - Bremen, GA)Oasis gives a tribute to this in their song \"Morning Glory\" with the line \"Walking to the sound of my favorite tune Tomorrow Never Knows what it doesn't know too soon.\" Oasis is well know for their similarity to the Beatles. (thanks, Dominic - Pittsburgh, PA)This song is featured on the 2006 Beatles album Love (a soundtrack to the Cirque du Soleil show based on their music) remixed with \"Within You Without You.\" (thanks, Ryan - London, England)","twist_and_shout":"A Philadelphia R\u0026B group called The Top Notes originally recorded this in 1961. It was a hit for The Isley Brothers in 1962, which is the version The Beatles emulated. Engineer Norman Smith explained how The Beatles version came about: \"Someone suggested they do 'Twist and Shout' with John taking the lead vocal. But by this time all their throats were sore; it was 12 hours since we had started working. John's, in particular, was almost completely gone so we really had to get it right the first time. The Beatles on the studio floor and us in the control room. John sucked a couple more Zubes (a brand of throat lozenges), had a bit of a gargle with milk and away we went.\"The Beatles used this to end many of their early live performances. It was always a huge hit when they played it in concert, and was chosen as their opening song at their Shea Stadium performance on August 15, 1965 - the first rock concert held in a stadium.John Lennon admitted that he screamed the lyrics. The Beatles had to sing loud when they did countless live shows in their early years.You can hear McCartney yell \"hey\" over the very last chord of this song, possibly because it was such a challenge doing the vocals with Lennon suffering from a cold (he was plagued with them his entire life). A lot of people think that the song was recorded once - a one time shot. They actually did two takes, and kept the first one. John was totally knackered, sick as a dog and had stripped off his shirt to let himself sweat it out, but he pulled it off. The next day - February 12, 1963 - The Beatles played two shows, one at the Azena Ballroom in Yorkshire and another at the Astoria Ballroom in Lancashire.In 1986, this charted again (at #23) when it was used in the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off.This was used in the Rodney Dangerfield movie Back To School.This was the first hit song written by Bert Berns. He went on to write songs for The Drifters, Ben E. King, and Van Morrison. He died of a heart attack in 1967.","two_of_us":"Paul McCartney wrote this about he and his wife Linda. When The Beatles were breaking up, it took on new meaning as a gesture of affection from Paul to John Lennon.Lennon and McCartney sang together on this. At the time, most of their songs were written by and contained a lead vocal from one or the other.This is mostly acoustic. It contains some electric guitar and no bass.This appears twice in the movie Let It Be, the first time as a duet by John and Paul.Lennon whistled on the fade-out.VH1 used the title for a fictional movie about Lennon and McCartney getting together in the '70s. This was the first original movie VH1 made. Others they produced include movies about Meat Loaf and Def Leppard.Other notable songs McCartney wrote for/about Linda: \"My Love,\" \"Maybe I'm Amazed,\" \"Calico Skies,\" \"Warm \u0026 Beautiful,\" \"Golden Earth Girl,\" \"Some days,\" \"She's My Baby,\" \"Long Haired Lady,\" and \"The Lovely Linda.\"See a photo and learn more about Paul and Linda in Song Images.","wait":"The Beatles recorded this during the last session for the album Help. They added bits and pieces in the last Rubber Soul session to create one more song for the album.It isn't quite clear why this song was left off the Help! album, except that it's much more folksy and fits in better with Rubber Soul anyway. Help! ended with \"Dizzy Miss Lizzy,\" a much more rousing and rockabilly number which gave the album the kind of ending the band felt it needed.\"Wait\" was written specifically for the film Help!. Paul McCartney recalls British child actor Brandon de Wilde being present while he was composing it, comparing him to a \"Brat Pack\" actor.The added percussion (including tambourine and maracas) was added in later to make the song better fit in with the Rubber Soul album.This is one of those songs of the Beatle canon with discrepancy as to authorship. It's known today to be credited to Lennon and McCarthy, but in his book Many Years from Now, McCartney credits the song entirely to himself, while another music publication of the time credits it entirely to Lennon.George Harrison puts a tone pedal to his guitar, rendering these unusually mellow sounds to the song and those last strumming notes at the final slow-down in tempo.The Beatles' tribute group Yellow Matter Custard covered this song.This is one of the few songs to have John and Paul alternating sole vocal roles. Usually either they sang in harmony, or one or the other took lead vocal duties. It's just one more thing that makes \"Wait\" unique.","we_can_work_it_out":"Paul McCartney wrote this about his girlfriend, an actress named Jane Asher. They split for good in 1968.The Beatles recorded this specifically for release as a single at two quick sessions while they were making the Rubber Soul album in October 1965. When it was released as a single backed with \"Day Tripper,\" debate raged over which was the A-side. Most pop groups put B-sides on their singles that were far inferior, but The Beatles often came out with 45s containing two great songs.John Lennon sang the \"life is very short\" part (which he also wrote); McCartney sang the rest. (thanks, John - Jacksonville, FL)A promotional film - one of the first music videos - was made to support this song. This was done in a shoot on November 23, 1965 at a film studio in London, where they recorded clips for four others songs as well. The Beatles did this so they could get their songs broadcast without actually appearing on the TV shows, clearing their schedules for other matters. They did three different version of \"We Can Work It Out,\" all with John Lennon at the organ.Stevie Wonder covered this on his 1970 album Signed, Sealed and Delivered. His version, which hit US #13, plays during the end credits of the 2005 movie Kicking And Screaming.In 2014, Wonder performed the song on the CBS special The Beatles: The Night That Changed America, which aired exactly 50 years after the group first performed on the Ed Sullivan Show. Wonder introduced the song by saying that he first heard it when he was 15 years old. \"It had a nice thing to it, but I said, Someday I'm going to do it again, with a little more funky thing with it,\" Wonder said when he introduced the song.In England, this was used in commercials for Hewlett-Packard.The only time The Beatles played this live was on their final British tour in November/December 1965. McCartney didn't perform the song until 1991, when he played it on his 1991 MTV Unplugged appearance. On his 2002 Back In The US tour, McCartney played a solo version on his acoustic guitar.In many KUMON (reading and writing centers) in Canada, there are posters of Paul and at the bottom, it says \"We Can Work It Out.\" (thanks, Scott Baddwin - Edmonton, England)This song was covered by The Four Seasons later in their career. Ironically, it was the popularity of The Beatles which was the major cause of the Seasons' dwindling success in the mid-late 1960s. (thanks, Nick - Tampa, FL)The line \"There's no time For fussing and fighting, my friend\" was used in the song \"You\" by Bad Religion. The songs share the theme of a fighting couple. (thanks, David - Flint, MI)","what_goes_on":"Left off the US version of Rubber Soul, this was released as the B-side to \"Nowhere Man\" in America. The song dates back to 1957, when the group was known as The Quarrymen. The Quarrymen were a Skiffle group, Skiffle being a king of music reminiscent of Country \u0026 Western with roots in Jazz, involving banjos and various improvised instruments such as a washboard and a washtub. John Lennon was tremendously influenced by Lonnie Donegan, and The Quarrymen in fact covered several Donegan songs. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)Ringo helped Lennon and McCartney write this and received his first songwriting credit for it - the composition credit on most Beatles songs is Lennon/McCartney, but this is credited to Lennon/McCartney/Starkey. Ringo also sang lead.Incidentally, this song being partially credited to \"Starkey\" is a good time to point out that Ringo Starr's actual name is \"Richard Starkey,\" a fact even some Beatles fans seem to be in the dark about.What was Ringo's comment on having received his first song-writing credit? At a 1966 press conference for the album, Ringo jested in his typical self-deprecating style that he'd written \"About five words, and I haven't done a thing since!\"John Lennon can be heard answering Ringo's vocal \"Tell me why,\" with \"I already told you why,\" A reference to their earlier song \"Tell Me Why.\"\"What Goes On\" is considered a follow-up to \"Please Please Me.\" Both songs have lyrics revolving around pining for a lover who doesn't love them back, and asking why it has to be that way.","what_youre_doing":"Paul McCartney wrote this. It is probably about his rocky relationship with actress Jane Asher.George Martin played piano on this track. (thanks, John - New York, NY, for above 2)An early Beatles track, they recorded in September 1964 at the same sessions as \"Every Little Thing\" and \"I Don't Want To Spoil The Party.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","whats_the_new_mary_jane":"This song was recorded for The White Album sessions, and was originally placed between \"Glass Onion\" and \"Happiness Is A Warm Gun,\" but was omitted because the album was getting too long.This is a somewhat experimental song much like \"Revolution 9.\" John Lennon said of the song, \"That was me Yoko and George sitting on the floor foolin' around, pretty good, huh?\" (thanks, Bianca Sanchez - Alburquerque, NM)","when_i_get_home":"John Lennon wrote the lyrics to this song, which is about going home to his girlfriend.A Hard Day's Night was the first Beatles album made up of all original Lennon/McCartney songs. The title came from something Ringo said during a radio interview. The UK version of the album featured a montage of head shots of the band members; the US version had one shot of each, showing only eyes and hair. It hit #1 in both the UK and the US. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2)","when_im_64":"Paul McCartney wrote the music for this when he was about 15, and used to play it when The Beatles were still known as The Quarrymen. He put lyrics to it later in honor of his father's 64th birthday.McCartney wrote and sang the lead vocals on this song which asks if a woman will still be with him when he got older, when he was 64 years old. On May 17, 2006, Paul and his then wife, Heather Mills, separated, finalizing the divorce in 2008. McCartney turned 64 on June 18, 2006, so the answer to his musical question with regards to Mills, would be no.John Lennon said of this: \"I would never even dream of writing a song like that.\"George Martin arranged this in the style of a 1920's big band, which came to be known as \"retro-rock.\" McCartney's vocal was sped-up a bit to add to the effect.This was the first song recorded for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.This was used in the Robin Williams movie The World According to Garp.This was a favorite of The Beatles at their early club shows, where they were required to play for hours. When their amps overheated, they would sing this around the piano. Julian Lennon, John's son, recorded a version of this that was used in 2002 commercials for Allstate insurance. This was not typical of Julian, who usually shied away from his father's legacy in an effort to forge his own identity.The title is also the name of a BBC television show starring Paul Freeman and Alun Armstrong as two older men who fall in love with each other. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2)A reference to this song appeared in the movie Shanghai Knights, starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. In the scene where Roy O'Bannon (Wilson) is fantasizing about his future family and life with Chon Lin, he mentions his kids' names: \"Vera, Chuck, and Dave.\" (thanks, Brittany - Virginia)In opening scenes of the 2007 musical Across The Universe, the main character, Jude, has his ticket stamped to New York by an elderly man who says that he would have left the city sooner when he was young, but he is now 64 and still working at the shipyard. It's a definite reference to McCartney's song that didn't make it into the movie, which features only Beatles songs. (thanks, Cameron Hirtle - Roseburg, OR)","while_my_guitar_gently_weeps":"Eric Clapton played lead guitar on this song. He and George Harrison were good friends, but George had to convince him to come to the studio because Clapton was worried the other Beatles wouldn't want him there. Clapton's presence eased the mood in the studio at a tense time for The Beatles - they were at each other's throats during recording of The White Album, but they all relaxed when Clapton showed up.Harrison often had to fight to get his songs on the albums. John Lennon and Paul McCartney were not interested in this song at first, but came around when Harrison brought Clapton to the studio.According to A Hard Day's Write by Steve Turner, Harrison was reading I Ching, the Chinese book of changes, and decided to write a song about the first words he saw, which were \"Gently Weeps.\" (thanks, Jonathan - Johnstown, PA)This was originally recorded as an acoustic ballad with just Harrison on acoustic guitar and Paul McCartney on organ. This version can be found on some bootlegs and on The Beatles Anthology 3. (thanks, Stefanie Magura - Rock Hill, SC)This was the first song Ringo played on after leaving the band in frustration a few weeks earlier. He returned to find flowers on his drums to welcome him back.The guitar Clapton used on this was a Les Paul. Later in his career, he switched to a Fender Stratocaster.Even though this was not a hit, it is one of the most enduring Beatles songs. It remains popular on classic rock radio.Clapton became good friends with Lennon, and played with him on some of his solo work. When Harrison threatened to leave The Beatles in 1969, Lennon was ready to replace him with Clapton.Jeff Healy covered this song on his 1990 album Hell To Pay. (thanks, Jay Fitzgerald - Saskatoon, Canada)In the Las Vegas show, LOVE, this song is included. In the show they use the Anthology version with a cello added. George Harrison came up with the idea for LOVE, though he died before the show was ever performed. (thanks, Breanna - Henderson, NV)Carlos Santana covered the song on his 2010 album Guitar Heaven. His version features vocals by India.Arie and cello by Yo-Yo Ma. \"When I think of that song,\" Arie told Rolling Stone, \"I always had this vision of George Harrison being at home with his wife and his kids, and going in at five o'clock in the morning and playing his guitar to himself. I imagined that and put a sensual energy on it.\"","why_dont_we_do_it_in_the_road":"Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr recorded this without the other Beatles. It was one of the first Beatles songs recorded without the whole group present, something they would do more often as their relationships deteriorated.John Lennon said this was one of Paul's best songs. He may have been joking.This contains only 2 lines of lyrics, and they are probably about sexual tension. (thanks, Dominic - Pittsburgh, PA)Apparently, McCartney got the idea for this while he was watching a pair of monkeys conducting business: \"I was up on a flat roof meditating and I'd see a troupe of monkeys walking along and the male just hopped onto her back and gave her one, as they say in the vernacular. Within two or three seconds he hopped off again, and looked around as if to say, 'it wasn't me,' and she looked around as if there had been some kind of mild disturbance but thought, huh, I must have imagined it. And I thought, bloody hell, that puts it all into a cocked hat, that's how simple the act of procreation is, this bloody monkey just hopping on and off. There is an urge, they do it, and it's done with. It's that simple.\" McCartney was in India at the time.This was a very John Lennon kind of song, John was very upset Paul did not include him in the recording of this. (thanks, Mike - Mountlake Terrace, WA. U.S.A, for above 2)","wild_honey_pie":"It was originally uncertain whether this 53-second oddity would be included on The White Album. According to Paul McCartney, the fact that George's then wife, Pattie Harrison, liked this piece a great deal sealed its inclusion.All instruments and vocals were performed byl McCartney. In their later years, The Beatles often recorded their parts separately.This evolved out of an impromptu sing-along at the Maharishi's retreat in India. The band went there to study meditation in 1968.This song was another that contributed to Charles Manson's belief that the Beatles were singing to him. According to the book Helter Skelter, the lines, \"Honey pie sail across the Atlantic\" meant that The Beatles wanted to meet him. Also from the song, Manson believed that Paul McCartney was saying he wanted Manson to put out a record. (thanks, Breanna - Henderson, NV)The Pixies covered this as part of their BBC Sessions album.","with_a_little_help_from_my_friends":"The album was recorded as if Sgt. Pepper was a real band. It opens with the title track, then segues into \"With A Little Help From My Friends.\" Beatles drummer Ringo Starr sang lead, introduced as \"Billy Shears,\" a name chosen because it sounded good and played up the idea that the group was in character.The song was never released as a single, but became one of the group's most enduring tracks. Since it there is no break on the album between the fade of the title track (and \"Billy Shears\" introduction) and the beginning of this song, radio stations were forced to either play the tracks together or play the awkward open.This was one of the very last songs John Lennon and Paul McCartney sat down and wrote together in a true collaboration. They were at Paul's house messing around on the piano.The original title was \"Badfinger Boogie.\" The Beatles got some use out of the name when they signed a group to their label, Apple Records, and named them Badfinger.The cheering at the beginning was taken from a Beatles concert at the Hollywood Bowl. The Beatles had stopped touring by the time this was recorded.This hit #1 on the UK chart three times: first by Joe Cocker in 1968, again by Wet Wet Wet in 1988 and finally by Sam and Mark in 2004. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)John Lennon claimed this was not about drugs, but many people didn't believe him, including US vice president Spiro Agnew, who once told a crowd that this song was a \"Tribute to the power of illegal drugs.\" He said the lines, \"I get by with a little help from my friends, I get high with a little help from my friends,\" \"Is a catchy tune, but until it was pointed out to me, I never realized that the 'friends' were assorted drugs!\" (thanks, Mike - Mountlake Terrace, WA. U.S.A)The first line was originally \"What would you do if I sang out of tune? Would you stand up and throw tomatoes at me?\" Ringo did not want to sing it, fearing that if they ever did it live he would be pelted with tomatoes.The Beatles finished recording this the night they shot the cover for the Sgt. Pepper album. This continued the \"Concept\" of the album, but until the reprise of \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" at the end, the theme of the fictional band ends with this.Twelve years after \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" appeared on the Sgt. Pepper album, they were released together as a two-song medley and reached US #71 and UK #63. (thanks, Jerro - New Alexandria, PA)When Ringo Starr was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, he performed this song with many of the evening's participants, including Joan Jett, Miley Cyrus, Dave Grohl, Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney.Joe Cocker's 1968 cover was used as the theme song for the '80s/'90s TV series The Wonder Years, starring Fred Savage.","within_you_without_you":"Although this song is billed as being recorded by the Beatles, George Harrison was the only Beatle to play on the track. There is no guitar or bass, but there are some hand-drums.Harrison spent weeks looking for musicians to play the Indian instruments used on this. It was especially difficult because Indian musicians could not read Western music.The laughter at the end was Harrison's idea to lighten the mood and follow the theme of the album. Some people thought it indicated that the song was included on Sgt. Pepper as a joke.This is based on a piece by Indian musician Ravi Shankar, who helped teach Harrison the sitar. Harrison wrote his own lyrics and shortened it considerably.Harrison wrote this as a 30-minute piece. He trimmed it down into a mini-version for the album.This was the only song Harrison wrote that made it onto the album. He also contributed \"Only A Northern Song\" (recorded in February of 1967 as verified by the Anthology 2 album), but it was left off the album at the last minute. It was initially intended to go on the first side of Sgt. Pepper between \"She's Leaving Home\" and \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite.\" (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)This was one of Harrison's first songs to explore Eastern religion, which would become a lifelong quest. He believed in reincarnation, which helped him accept death in 2001, when he lost his life to cancer.Oasis covered this for the BBC to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)This is the second Indian classical-influenced song that George Harrison wrote for the Beatles, the first being \"Love You To.\"\"Now \"Within You/Without You\" was not a commercial song by any means. But it was very interesting. [George Harrison] had a way of communicating music by the Indian system of kind of a separate language... the rhythms decided by the tabla player.\" --Sir George Martin, from the documentary The Material World.","yellow_submarine":"Paul McCartney wrote this one. He explained shortly after it was released in 1966: \"'Yellow Submarine' is very simple but very different. It's a fun song, a children's song. Originally we intended it to be 'Sparky' a children's record. But now it's the idea of a yellow submarine where all the kids went to have fun. I was just going to sleep one night and thinking if we had a children's song, it would be nice to be on a yellow submarine where all your friends are with a band.\"Paul purposely used short words in the lyrics because he wanted kids to pick it up early and sing along.Ringo sang lead, as he did on many of the lighter Beatles songs, including \"Octopus's Garden\" and \"Act Naturally.\" Originally, Ringo had a spoken intro to go with the children's story theme, but this was discarded. Ringo did eventually get his chance to narrate for children: he was voice talent on the UK cartoon Thomas The Tank Engine. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)As with just about every Beatles song, there's a lot that can be read into this one if you look hard enough. One possible interpretation: Once famous, The Beatles were forced to stay in hotel rooms and live under pressure = Submarine. Because they were having a great time it was Yellow (friends are all aboard). Sea of green = money. (thanks, mike - los angeles, CA)The sounds of bubbles, water, and other noises were recorded in the studio. The background vocals (and some effects) were done by John, Paul, and George and they had some help on the fadeout chorus by Mal Evans, Neil Aspinall, George Martin, Alf Bicknell (their chauffeur), Geoff Emerick, Brian Jones, Marianne Faithful, Pattie Harrison and a few other staff people that were in the building at the time. The \"bubble\" effects are John blowing into a straw. All of the speaking parts are done by John and Paul.Some people felt this song had deeper meaning about drugs or war. The Beatles said it did not, but they were used to people reading too much into their songs. On The White Album, there is a song called \"Glass Onion\" that addresses this issue.The chorus at the end consists of the studio crew, as well as their friends Mal Evans and Neil Aspinall, producer George Martin, and Pattie Harrison. The famous folk singer Donovan, who was McCartney's friend and neighbor at the time, helped him with uncredited lyrical contributions on this song. He likely also recorded backing vocals in the chorus. (thanks, Jonathon - Clermont, FL)According to Steve Turner's book A Hard Day's Write, about a month after the album was released, there were barbiturate capsules that started to be known as \"yellow submarines.\" McCartney denied any comparison to drugs and said the only submarine he knew that you could eat was a sugary sweet he's come across in Greece while on holiday. These had to be dropped in water and were known as \"submarines.\" (thanks, Ant - Belleville, Canada)This was the title song from an animated movie featuring The Beatles as cartoons. The Beatles had a lot going on at the time, so actors were brought in to voice their lines. In the film, The Beatles try to save Pepperland from the Blue Meanies, who hate music. We won't spoil it by telling you how it ends.The photographic scenes shown in the movie Yellow Submarine are of well-known locations in England, including Buckingham Palace and Big Ben. (thanks, Patrick - Tallapoosa, GA)After he got the idea for the song, McCartney dropped by Donovan's place and asked him for suggestions to close the tune. Donovan came up with \"Sky of blue, sea of green.\" Donovan went with The Beatles on their retreat to India in 1968.This was used as the B-side of \"Eleanor Rigby.\"In 2004, McCartney voiced over 3 animated short films for a project called The Music And Animation Collection. He explained that it was much more fun voicing other characters, and he had no interest in using his own voice on the Yellow Submarine movie.Spanish premier division soccer team Villareal is nicknamed \"Los Submarinos Amarillos\" (Spanish for \"Yellow Submarine\") because of their yellow uniforms. (thanks, mark - Rotterdam, Netherlands)According to Q magazine, this song originally featured a medieval-style poem as an intro. Written by Lennon and narrated by Starr, the poem was inspired by a 1960 charity walk from the south west tip of England to the northern coast of Scotland by pioneering health enthusiast Dr. Barbara Moore.","yer_blues":"John Lennon wrote this in India while The Beatles were on a retreat learning meditation with the Maharishi.John used \"yer\" instead of \"your\" in the title so as not to be taken too seriously. The song is a good-natured jab at the British blues scene.A 9 minute version with Lennon, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and Mitch Mitchell was performed on the Rolling Stones' Rock 'n' Roll Circus. Taped as a British TV special in 1968, it never aired but was released on video in 1995. This was Lennon's first performance without The Beatles.This was the only Beatles song Lennon performed at the Toronto Rock 'n' Roll Revival concert in 1969. Eric Clapton joined him for this on guitar. After playing with him at the Toronto show, Lennon asked Clapton to join his Plastic Ono Band. Clapton considered it, but had other obligations.The line \"Feel so suicidal, just like Dylan's Mr. Jones\" is a reference to Bob Dylan's song \"Ballad of a Thin Man.\"In a Rolling Stone interview, Ringo said this song was one of his all-time favorite sessions: \"We were just in an 8 foot room, with no separation, just doing what we do best: playing.\" (thanks, VinnyVegas - Durham, NC)Ringo's count-in was edited from another take.The Beatles recorded this in Abbey Road Studio Two's \"annex,\" a side room which McCartney referred to as \"a cupboard.\" They jammed together from 7pm to 5am and after 14 takes produced this parody of British blues.McCartney told Lennon not to title this song \"Year Blues,\" but \"just say it straight.\" However he kept the title as he was self conscious about singing blues. In the January 1971 edition of Rolling Stone, Lennon explained this was because, \"We were all listening to Sleepy John Estes and all that in art school, like everybody else. But to sing it was something else. I'm self conscious about doing it.\"","yes_it_is":"This Doo-Wop style ballad was written by John Lennon, who never cared much for the song and later claimed he was simply rewriting \"This Boy.\"This was the second Beatles song with a three-part lead harmony, a technique they didn't use again until the 1969 song \"Because.\" This was the first Beatles song where they used guitar effects. George Harrison used a tone pedal on the track.An outtake of this song appears on The Beatles Anthology album. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for all above)","yesterday":"This is the most covered pop song of all time, with over 3,000 versions recorded according to The Guinness Book Of World Records. For years, it was also the song with the most radio plays, but in 1999 BMI music publishing reported that \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" had passed it. Still, at any given time, some version of \"Yesterday\" is probably being broadcast somewhere.Paul McCartney wrote this song and was the only Beatle to play on it. It was the first time a Beatle recorded without the others, and marked a shift to more independent accomplishments among the group. While John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote The Beatles early songs together, by 1965 most of their songs were primarily written by one or the other, although they continued to credit all their songs Lennon/McCartney.A string quartet was brought in to play on this track. In addition to the strings, this is notable as one of the first pop songs to use elements of classical music.This was the first Beatles song that could not be reproduced live without additional musicians. When they played it live, including their famous Shea Stadium concert, it was just McCartney with an acoustic guitar.McCartney claimed that while The Beatles were touring in Paris, he tumbled out of bed and this tune was in his head. He thought he had heard it somewhere before, and played the melody to different people in the music industry to make sure he wasn't stealing it. The working title was \"Scrambled Eggs\" until Paul could figure out lyrics.This was the first Beatles song to capture a mass adult market. Most of their fans were young people to this point, but this song gave the band a great deal of credibility among the older crowd. It also became one of their \"Muzak\" classics, as companies recorded instrumental versions as soothing background noise for shopping centers and elevators. Another Beatles song that lived on in this form is \"Here Comes The Sun.\"McCartney wrote some of the lyrics during a five-hour car trip from Lisbon to Albufeira (in Algarve, south of Portugal), on the 27th of May 1965, when he was on vacation with Jane Asher. The villa where Paul and Jane stayed was owned by Shadows' guitarist Bruce Welch. Bruce said that when he was packing to leave, Paul asked him if he had a guitar because (Paul) was working on the lyrics since the airport. Said Bruce: \"He borrowed my guitar and started playing the song we all now know as 'Yesterday'.\" (thanks, Rato - Lisbon, Portugal)The Beatles performed this on their third live Ed Sullivan Show appearance and on their last tour. For the live appearances, McCartney would play with a prerecorded backing track of strings.McCartney says that when he performed it on Sullivan, just before the curtain opened a stagehand asked him, \"Are you nervous?\" \"No,\" Paul lied, to which the man responded, \"You should be. There's 73 million people watching.\"This was one of five Beatles songs McCartney performed on his \"Wings Over America\" tour in 1976.McCartney had to ask Michael Jackson to use this in his movie Give My Regards to Broadstreet. Jackson outbid McCartney for the publishing rights to The Beatles catalogue, something that fractured their friendship as McCartney counseled Jackson on the value of publishing rights.McCartney has consistently talked about how easy this song was for him to compose. In describing it, he has said \"I did the tune easily and then the words took about two weeks.\" (thanks, Shannon - Kathleen, GA)This song caused a rift between McCartney and Yoko Ono. When The Beatles Anthology album was released, McCartney asked that the writing credit on this read \"McCartney/Lennon,\" since he wrote it. Yoko refused, and it was listed as \"Lennon/McCartney,\" which is how they usually credited songs written by either Beatle (between Please Please Me and With The Beatles, the song credits turned from McCartney/Lennon to Lennon/McCartney). In 2003, McCartney switched the writing credit for the first time when he listed 19 Beatles songs on his Back In The US album as \"Paul McCartney and John Lennon.\" Paul claims he and John made an informal agreement in 1962 regarding the credits, but he had every right to switch it if he chose. Yoko disagreed.Some of the artists who have covered this song include Boyz II Men, Ray Charles, En Vogue, Marianne Faithfull, Marvin Gaye, Tom Jones, Nana Mouskouri, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, The Supremes, The Toys, Andy Williams, and Tammy Wynette. (thanks, Jerro - New Alexandria, PA)This was featured in the 1997 movie Bean, when the title character (played by Rowan Atkinson) sings it with David Langley (played by Peter MacNicol) as they trot home one night. (thanks, Tiffany - Dover, FL)Paul McCartney's first performance at the Grammys came in 2006. He joined in with Jay-Z and the lead singer of Linkin Park to sing part of the lyrics to this song. Paul also performed \"Fine Line\" and \"Helter Skelter\" earlier in the show. (thanks, Patrick - Statesville, NC)When McCartney played this song, he tuned his guitar one tone lower than usual. On a recording that can be heard on The Beatles Anthology, he explains to the musicians before the song: \"I'm in G, but it's F.\" (thanks, Mikhail Povorin - Moscow, Russia Federation)John Lennon referenced this song in his anti-McCartney solo effort \"How Do You Sleep?\" with the lyrics, ''The only thing you've done was yesterday, and since you've gone you're just another day.\" (thanks, Jordan - Buffalo, NY)Carrie Underwood performed this song at the Primetime Emmy Awards on September 22, 2013 in honor of The Beatles historic Ed Sullivan Show appearance nearly 50 years earlier (February 9, 1964). Underwood's performance was conceived as an affirmation of the power of television and its impact on music and entertainment, as she got her start on the TV show American Idol.Underwood didn't switch the gender for her performance, singing \"I'm not half the man I used to be.\"","you_cant_do_that":"The Beatles recorded this in nine takes on George Harrison's 21st Birthday (in the same session as \"And I Love Her\" and \"I Should Have Known Better\"), although in May, producer George Martin overdubbed a piano making a 10th take that wasn't used. The one that saw the light of the day was Take 9. (thanks, Ben - Cheverly, MD)This was filmed for the movie A Hard Day's Night, but did not make the cut. It was, however, included on the movie's soundtrack, which was released by the film's production company United Artists. Since United Artists had the soundtrack rights, The Beatles' American label, Capitol, released it as the B-side of \"Can't Buy Me Love.\" (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)John Lennon played lead guitar. He normally played rhythm while George Harrison played lead. Ringo played the cowbell.This was the first Beatles song on which George Harrison played a 12-string guitar.John Lennon told the British journalist Ray Connolly that this song was his attempt at being pioneering American soul singer Wilson Pickett.Harry Nilsson covered this song on his 1967 debut album, Pandemonium Shadow Show as a tribute to The Beatles' music in general. It is performed at a slower tempo, and throughout the song lines from other Beatles songs are sung in counterpoint, ending with the line \"Strawberry Beatles Forever.\" (thanks, David - Mesa, AZ)","you_know_my_name_look_up_the_number":"The Beatles started recording the song in 1967, adding all the instrumentation and a saxophone part played by Brian Jones from The Rolling Stones. Lennon and McCartney added all of the crazy vocals in April 1969. Finally, it was released as the B-side of the \"Let It Be\" single in 1970. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)John Lennon got the idea for this when he saw a phone book on Paul McCartney's piano.McCartney: \"My favorite Beatles track... because it's so insane.\"This is one of four Beatles songs never released in stereo. The others are \"Love Me Do,\" \"I'll Get You\" and \"She Loves You.\"","you_know_what_to_do":"This is just the second song that George Harrison wrote; it was not released until the Anthology CDs came out. It was originally going to be on the Meet the Beatles album, but was ultimately replaced with \"Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby.\" (thanks, Breanna - Henderson, NV)","you_like_me_too_much":"George Harrison's songwriting would evolve over the next few years and flourish with introspective compositions like \"Something\" and \"Within You Without You,\" but on this song, he wrote about being in love with a girl and knowing that despite her threats, she will never leave him. After all, she likes him too much.Both a Steinway grand piano and a Hohner Pianet electric piano were used on this song. The Beatles didn't use much electric piano, but the Hohner Pianet also showed up on another song from Help!: \"The Night Before.\" (thanks, Maya - Richmond, BC)","you_never_give_me_your_money":"This song is about The Beatles' business problems. When their manager Brian Epstein died in 1967, they were burdened with handling their own finances, which became a source of tension in the band.This is the first of a medley of songs on Abbey Road, which goes another 15 minutes to \"The End.\"By 1969, members of The Beatles had a lot of unfinished song ideas, which they sometimes combined. This contains fragments of four songs put into one.Regarding the lines, \"You never give me your money, you only give me your funny paper,\" \"Funny Paper\" is how The Beatles felt they were paid. They got frustrated when their accountants would tell them how much they were worth \"on paper,\" without actually telling them how much money they had.Paul McCartney played this combined with \"Carry That Weight\" on his 2002 \"Back In The US\" tour.","you_wont_see_me":"Paul McCartney wrote this about his tumultuous 5-year relationship with the actress Jane Asher. He wrote it one night after she had walked out. (thanks, Adrian - Wilmington, DE)Up to this point, McCartney wrote lots of \"Silly Love Songs. This was a departure lyrically, as the song was more personal and mature, and also a little bitter, which reflects how he felt about his relationship with Jane Asher. Another Rubber Soul song, \"I'm Looking Through You,\" is also about Asher and is similarly scathing. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)A cover version by the country singer Anne Murray hit #8 US in 1974.Mal Evans, The Beatles road manager, played the Hammond organ.This was recorded in two takes. In their early years, The Beatles did so many live shows that they had no trouble recording quickly.The melody for the Chicago hit \"Saturday In The Park\" is based on this song.","youre_gonna_lose_that_girl":"This song is a continuation of the story from \"She Loves You. In that song, it's established that the girl is crazy about the guy being sung to - this song makes it clear that he must take action or risk losing her. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)","youve_got_to_hide_your_love_away":"It was rumored that this was the first gay rock song, a message to Beatles manager Brian Epstein, who was gay. In the part of The Beatles Anthology, that covers Epstein's death, this song is played, giving credence to the idea that this song was indeed a song about hiding one's homosexuality. (thanks, Patrickman - Makati City)John Lennon told Rolling Stone in 1971, that when he wrote this, he was just knocking out pop songs, without expressing his own personal emotions to any great extent: He explained: \"I was in Kenwood (his home at the time) and I would just be songwriting. The period would be for songwriting and so every day I would attempt to write a song and it's one of those that you sort of sing a bit sadly to yourself, 'Here I stand, head in hand...'\"Lennon then went on to say how listening to Bob Dylan was beginning to influence his songwriting around the time he wrote this. He recalled: \"I started thinking about my own emotions - I don't know when exactly it started like 'I'm a Loser' or 'Hide Your Love Away' or those kind of things- instead of projecting myself into a situation I would just try to express what I felt about myself which I'd done in me books. I think it was Dylan helped me realize that - not by any discussion or anything but just by hearing his work - I had a sort of professional songwriter's attitude to writing pop songs; he would turn out a certain style of song for a single and we would do a certain style of thing for this and the other thing. I was already a stylized songwriter on the first album. But to express myself I would write Spaniard in the Works or In His Own Write, the personal stories which were expressive of my personal emotions. I'd have a separate songwriting John Lennon who wrote songs for the sort of meat market, and I didn't consider them - the lyrics or anything - to have any depth at all. They were just a joke. Then I started being me about the songs, not writing them objectively, but subjectively.\"The line \"feeling two foot small\" was written \"feeling two foot tall.\" Lennon sang it wrong but liked it and left it that way.Session musicians played flutes. It was the first time outsiders played on a Beatles record.Lennon's friend Pete Shotton came up with the \"Hey\"s in the chorus.Joe Cocker in 1991 on his album Night Calls. Cocker previously covered The Beatles \"I'll Cry Instead,\" \"With A Little Help From My Friends\" and \"She Came In Through The Bathroom Window.\"","your_mother_should_know":"As detailed in Beatles In They're Own Words by Barry Miles, Paul McCartney wrote this at his place on Cavendish Avenue in London on the harmonium in the dining room. His Aunty Jin, Uncle Harry, and other relatives were there, and he just sat and wrote it for a few hours with the door opened so they could all listen from another room. Paul said, \"I was basically trying to say your mother might know more than you think she does. Give her credit.\" He also said that the family atmosphere and his Aunty Jin being there influenced it and its music-hall idea. (thanks, Julia - OH)This was used in the last scene of the movie Magical Mystery Tour, where the four Beatles dance in tuxedos. Paul McCartney wore a black carnation while the others wore red, fueling rumors that Paul was dead.Every Mother's Day, this is still a very popular song. There are surprisingly few contemporary songs with the word \"Mother\" in the title that are actual tributes to mothers.The vocals are on the left channel for the first verse, move to the right for the second, then back to the left for the third. The song has an old-fashioned sound to fit with the idea that it's a favorite of a past generation."}
